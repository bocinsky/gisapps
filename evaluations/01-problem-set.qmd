# Task 1

@Clayton:2018 considers measures of implicit bias for multiple participants from an "in-field implicit association tests". The [codebook](https://lbelzile.github.io/hecedsm/reference/C18.html) contains a description of the data.


1. What is the population under study?
2. Identify the type of sampling.
3. What are the observational and experimental units? How many observations are there for each in the sample?
4. Comment on the quality of the sample and the generalizability of the findings.
5. Identify the response variable and the treatment levels.

# Task 2: Getting started

Starting from next week, you will need to perform statistical analyses using a suitable software. Most programming language with dedicated statistics module can be used to perform the analyses we will cover in class.

Property software options include IBM SPSS Statistics (Windows and Mac only) and SAS. HEC MontrÃ©al provides download for [SPSS](https://hecmontreal.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DTIKB/pages/1952252037) and SAS, but the latter can be freely accessed using the cloud-based version SAS OnDemand for Academics.

I am a strong advocate of **R**. Other open-access options include Python and Julia.

If you are more comfortable with click-and-drop menus, JAMOVI, PSPP (the GNU equivalent of SPSS) and JASP are suitable options.
