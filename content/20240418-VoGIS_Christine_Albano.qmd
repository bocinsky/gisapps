## Expert Biography

[Christine Albano](https://www.dri.edu/directory/christine-albano/){target="_blank"} is an Assistant Research Professor in Hydrologic Sciences at the Desert Research Institute. Her research is centered on better understanding impacts of climate variability and extremes on human and natural systems in the western United States. She is part of the team that led discussions on the implications of a series of extreme winter atmospheric river storms (the [ARkStorm scenario](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2010/1312/){target="_blank"}) in the Greater Lake Tahoe area in 2013. The team is now re-engaging an expanded community in this region with the [ARkStorm 2.0 scenario](https://www.dri.edu/project/arkstormsierrafront-2-0/){target="_blank"}, which will incorporate new modeling capabilities and lessons learned from recent storms and flooding.

## Preparation
Christine shared several resources about the ARkStorm scenarios. **Please have a look at at least one of them before submitting your questions.**

- [A description of the ARkStorm 2.0 scenario](https://weatherwest.com/archives/16626){target="_blank"}
- [The ARkStorm 2.0 Scenario Explorer dashboard](https://climate-engine.shinyapps.io/arkstorm-sandbox/){target="_blank"} — A **DRAFT** Shiny application displaying the ARkStorm 2.0 scenarios
- [ARkStorm@Tahoe: Stakeholder Perspectives on Vulnerabilities and Preparedness for an Extreme Storm Event in the Greater Lake Tahoe, Reno and Carson City Region](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/webfiles.dri.edu/Projects/ARkStormTahoe2/ARkStormTahoeFinalReportUNR2014.pdf){target="_blank"} — A lengthy report on the ARkStorm 1.0 scenario and outcomes

### Assignment
Please submit two short questions you would like Kyle to consider asking Christine. These can be about the materials, Christine's career and training, or more general questions about careers in GIS related to hydroclimatology, climate variability and extremes, and scenario planning.

Please submit your questions by Wednesday, April 17 at 11:59 PM to this Microsoft Form: <https://forms.office.com/r/tDDFD87yJK>{target="_blank"}.
