## Preparation
Please read [Chapter 3. Scale and Projections](https://open.lib.umn.edu/mapping/chapter/3-scale-and-projections/){target="_blank"} from [Mapping, Society, and Technology](https://open.lib.umn.edu/mapping/){target="_blank"} [@Manson:2017].

Also, there are some very fun tools and websites that will be introduced during the lecture:

- <https://map-projections.net>{target="_blank"} --- a very cool tool for comparing map projections
- <https://epsg.io>{target="_blank"} and <https://epsg.org>{target="_blank"} --- the authoritative database of coordinate reference systems
- [The latest documentation on coordinate reference systems in ArcPro](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/mapping/properties/coordinate-systems-and-projections.htm){target="_blank"}
- [A new double-sided map projection of Earth](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/24/science/new-world-map.html){target="_blank"}
- [An August 2020 update on the development of new Low Distortion Projections (LDPs) for Montana](https://www.marls.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/New-State-Plane-Coordinate-System-is-in-the-works.pdf){target="_blank"}
- [The Rocky Mountain Coordinate Reference System](https://www.marls.com/resources/rmtcrs-information/)
