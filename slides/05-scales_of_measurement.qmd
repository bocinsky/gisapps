## Scales of Measurement
The scale indicates the data summarization and
statistical analyses that are most appropriate.
The scale determines the amount of information
contained in the data.
Scales of measurement include:
Nominal
Ordinal
Interval
Ratio

## Nominal
A nonnumeric label or numeric code may be used.
Data are labels or names used to identify an
attribute of the element.

## Nominal
Example:
Students of a university are classified by the
     dorm that they live in using a nonnumeric label 
     such as Farley, Keenan, Zahm, Breen-Phillips, 
     and so on.

A numeric code can be used for the school variable (e.g. 1: Farley, 2: Keenan, 3: Zahm, and so on).


## Ordinal
A nonnumeric label or numeric code may be used.
The data have the properties of nominal data and
the order or rank of the data is meaningful .

## Ordinal
Example:
Students of a university are classified by their
class standing using a nonnumeric label such as
Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, or Senior.
A numeric code can be used for
the class standing variable (e.g. 1 denotes
Freshman, 2 denotes Sophomore, and so on).

## Interval
Interval data are always numeric .
The data have the properties of ordinal data, and
the interval between observations is expressed in
terms of a fixed unit of measure.

## Interval
Example: Average Starting Salary Offer 2003
Economics/Finance: $40,084
History: $32,108
Psychology: $27,454
Econ & Finance majors earn $7,976 more than
History majors and $12,630 more than
Psychology majors.

## Ratio
The data have all the properties of interval data
and the ratio of two values is meaningful .
Variables such as distance, height, weight, and time
use the ratio scale.
This scale must contain a zero value that indicates
that nothing exists for the variable at the zero point.

## Ratio
Example:
Econ & Finance majors salaries are 1.24 times
History major salaries and are 1.46 times
Psychology major salaries

## Qualitative versus Quantitative data
 Data can be qualitative or quantitative.
 The appropriate statistical analysis depends
 on whether the data for the variable are qualitative
 or quantitative.
 There are more options for statistical
 analysis when the data are quantitative.

## Qualitative Data
Labels or names used to identify an attribute of each
element. E.g., Black or white, male or female.
Referred to as categorical data
Use either the nominal or ordinal scale of
measurement
Can be either numeric or nonnumeric
Appropriate statistical analyses are rather limited

## Quantitative Data
Quantitative data indicate how many or how much:
 Discrete, if measuring how many. E.g., number
 of 6-packs consumed at tail-gate party
Continuous, if measuring how much. E.g., pounds 
 of hamburger consumed at tail-gate party
 Quantitative data are always numeric.
 Ordinary arithmetic operations are meaningful for
 quantitative data.

## Cross-sectional Data
 Cross-sectional data observations across individuals
 at the same point in time, or aggregated over the same time period.
 Example:  the growth rate from 1960 to 2004 of
 each country in the world (about 182 of them).
 Example: wages for head of household in 
 Indiana
 
## Time Series Data
Time series data are collected over several time
 periods.
Example:  the sequence of U.S. GDP growth each
Year from 1960 to 2005 
Example: the sequence of Professor Markâ€™s wage
 each year from 1983 to 2005.
