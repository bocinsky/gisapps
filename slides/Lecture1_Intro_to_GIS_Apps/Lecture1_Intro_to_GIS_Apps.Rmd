#  SO…… WHAT’s…… IMPORTANT? 

A good Map gives the user access to the data that is not readily available in the table. GIS answers questions that only spatial analysis can!
(It also should keep their eyes from rolling back in their heads as they drift off to a happy place!)
ABOVE ALL… Make maps people want to look at!! (Which will give you about 2 more seconds to teach them something!)
