#  So… Where’s the Beef? 

The ellipsoid and geoid only matter if you are building\customizing reference systems…...
In common use, just know that they are incorporated within the datum (GCS):
+ NAD 27 uses the Clarke 1866 Ellipsoid
+ NAD 83 uses the GRS 1980 Ellipsoid
+ WGS 84 uses the EGM 1996 Ellipsoid
Etc….
TAKE HOME: These 3 Datum are what you will use 90% of the time. If you need another, look it up! http://epsg.io/

#  Side Note: Best Practices for Re-projection 

Conversions from NAD 27 to NAD 83 are common and have well established transformation algorithms.
However, transformations between lesser known datum can sometimes cause misalignments. So, technically, you must climb down the ladder all the way, and then climb all the way back up!
For example, the correct way to transform NAD 27 MT State Plane to NAD 83 Albers Contiguous US is:
+ NAD 27 MT State Plane to NAD 27
+ NAD 27 to NAD 83
+ NAD 83 to NAD 83 Albers Contiguous US

#  Projections 

Literally “Projected” through a transparent globe.
They come in two cases:
Tanget
Secant

#  Projections – Distilled  

What is the nature of the phenomena to be analyzed?
In other words, do you want to compare:
Area,
Distance,
Shape,
or
Direction
To Choose a Projection Ask…

---
#  Projections – You Have to Choose One 

Azimuthal — Direction from a given central point to any other point is shown correctly. Use to evaluate the direction phenomena move from a location.
Conformal — Angles and shapes at each point are preserved. Use to compare the shape of phenomena in relation to one another.
Equal-area — All areas have the same relative area as the corresponding part on the Earth. Use to compare phenomena measured in areal units.
Equidistant — Shows true distances from a center point or along a special set of lines. Use to measure the spread of phenomena or actual route distance.

---
#  Projections – In 3 East Steps 

TAKE HOME: The Equal-area projection is by far the most popular for thematic mapping. Set the datum in the GDB, and project from the mapframe in GIS.
Determine if you data is best analyzed by area, distance, shape, or direction.
Choose the best projection compromise for your data type.
Select the best projection for the geographic extent being mapped.

#  Scale 

Scale—The relationship between a distance on a map and the corresponding distance on the Earth.
Three Types
Representative Fraction – 1:100,000
Verbal Scale – 1 inch to the Mile
Graphic Scale – Scale Bar
![](03-slides/assets/img/image20.png)

#  Scale 

Scale varies across Small Scale Maps of the World
This would be the correct scale on a Mercator World Map.

#  Scale 

TAKE HOME: Scale is not equal across all areas of a small scale projection. On world maps, a static scale bar is virtually useless. A Conic Projection is a good compromise for true scale when mapping mid-latitude continents.
