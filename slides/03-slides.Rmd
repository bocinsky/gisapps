# F-test for one way ANOVA

.box-inv-2.medium[Global null hypothesis]

No difference between treatments

- $\mathscr{H}_0$ (null): all of the $K$ treatment groups have the same average $\mu$
- $\mathscr{H}_a$ (alternative): at least two treatments have different averages

Tacitly assume that all observations have the same standard deviation $\sigma$.

???

- The null hypothesis can be viewed as a special case from a bigger class of possibilities
- it always corresponds to some restrictions from the alternative class

With $K$ groups and $n$ observations, the statistic is

# Null distribution and degrees of freedom


The null distribution (benchmark) is a Fisher distribution $\mathsf{F}(\nu_1, \nu_2)$.


The parameters $\nu_1, \nu_2$ are called **degrees of freedom**.

For the one-way ANOVA:

- $\nu_1 = K-1$ is the number of constraints imposed by the null (number of groups minus one)
- $\nu_2 = n-K$ is the number of observations minus number of mean parameters estimated under alternative

???

The number of constraints come from the fact we go from K means under alternative, to 1 mean under null.

# Intuition behind _F_-distribution

If all groups have the same mean, both numerator and denominator are estimators of $\sigma^2$, thus
- the $F$ ratio should be 1 on average if there are no mean differences.
- but the numerator is more variable because it is based on $K$ observations
  - benchmark is skewed to the right.

# Impact of encouragement on teaching

From Davison (2008), Example 9.2

> In an investigation on the teaching of arithmetic, 45 pupils were divided at random into five groups of nine. Groups A and B were taught in separate classes by the usual method. Groups C, D, and E were taught together for a number of days. On each day C were praised publicly for their work, D were publicly reproved and E were ignored. At the end of the period all pupils took a standard test.

# Formulating an hypothesis

Let $\mu_A, \ldots,  \mu_E$ denote the population average (expectation) score for the test for each experimental condition.

The null hypothesis is 
$$\mathscr{H}_0: \mu_A = \mu_B = \cdots = \mu_E$$
against the alternative $\mathscr{H}_a$ that at least one of the population average is different.

# Thinking about power

What do you think is the effect on **power** of an increase of the
- group sample size $n_1, \ldots, n_K$.
- variability $\sigma^2$.
- true mean difference $\mu_j - \mu$.


---

# What happens under the alternative?

The peak of the distribution shifts to the right.

Why? on average, the numerator of the $F$-statistic is

$$\begin{align*}
\mathsf{E}(\text{between-group variability}) = \sigma^2+ \frac{\sum_{j=1}^K n_j(\mu_j - \mu)^2}{K-1}.
\end{align*}$$


Under the null hypothesis, $\mu_j=\mu$ for $j=1, \ldots, K$
   - the rightmost term is 0.


---

# Noncentrality parameter and power

The alternative distribution is $F(\nu_1, \nu_2, \Delta)$ distribution with degrees of freedom $\nu_1$ and $\nu_2$ and noncentrality parameter 
$$\begin{align*}
\Delta = \dfrac{\sum_{j=1}^K n_j(\mu_j - \mu)^2}{\sigma^2}.
\end{align*}$$

 \left(\begin{matrix} \text{quantity depending only }\\

tend to have higher variability when the response is larger.

# Fixes for multiplicative data

A log-transformation of response makes the model **additive**.

For responses bounded between $a$ and $b$, reduce warping effects via
$$\ln\left\{\frac{x-a+\delta}{b+\delta-x}\right\}$$

Careful with transformations: 
- lose interpretability
- change of meaning (different scale/units).

???

If we consider a response on the log-scale, the test is for equality of the geometric mean!

???

Difference in average response; while the treatment seems to lead to a decrease in the response variable, a stratification by age group reveals this only occurs in less than 25 group, with a seemingly reversed effect for the adults. Thus, the marginal model implied by the one-way analysis of variance is misleading.

---

# A note about interactions

An **interaction** occurs when the effect of experimental group depends on another variable.

In principle, randomization ensures we capture the average marginal effect (even if misleading/useless).

We could incorporate the interacting variable in the model capture it's effect (makes model more complex), e.g. using a two-way ANOVA.

Bartlett is uniformly most powerful for normal data.

Levene and BF are most commonly used in practice (so far of what I have seen)

# Solutions

- In large sample, power is large so probably always reject $\mathscr{H}_0: \sigma_1 = \cdots = \sigma_K$.
- If heterogeneity only per experimental condition, use **Welch's ANOVA** (`oneway.test` in **R**).
- This statistic estimates the std. deviation of each group *separately*.
- Could (should?) be the default when you have large number of observations, or enough to reliably estimate mean and std. deviation.

Can check normality via quantile-quantile plot with standardized residuals $r_i$:

- on the $x$-axis, the theoretical quantiles $\widehat{F}^{-1}\{\mathrm{rank}(r_i)/(n+1)\}$ of the residuals, where $F^{-1}$ is the normal quantile function.
