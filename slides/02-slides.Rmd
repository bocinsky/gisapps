Some ways of knowing:

- Personal experiences
- Cultural traditions
  - Education
  - Accumulation of historical and philosophical insights
- The Scientific Method
  - exploration

#  What is the scientific method?
The modern scientific method is based on the work of René Descartes, one of the founders of contemporary Western science and philosophy. 

Four rules of Cartesian inquiry:

1. Accept nothing as true that is not self-evident
2. Divide each problem into as many parts as possible
3. Proceed from the simplest to the most complex
4. Review everything to avoid errors

#  How do we form **spatial** hypotheses? 

It starts with an observation, which then leads to a question about what was seen.

 - While most things have a spatial component, it is worth asking if your observation has nothing to do with location.

 - Once you believe your question has a spatial component, you can convert it to a hypothesis to be tested with GIS.

#  How do we form a spatial hypotheses? 

**1. OBSERVATION**

Trees at the top of the slope are dying.

--

**2. QUESTION**

Does elevation have anything to do with tree health?

--

**3. HYPOTHESES**

More trees die at higher elevations than at lower elevations.

--

**4. EXPERIMENT**

Randomly sample trees at different elevations to see if significantly more are dying on higher slopes.

#  Applications of GIS 

What kinds of spatial problems can you use a geographic information system to answer?

# Can Missoula meet its electricity needs<br>with roof-top solar? 


The earth at sea level receives about 1,000 Watts per square meter.

How can we use GIS to answer this question? What data do we need?

#  SO WHAT's IMPORTANT? 

.large[**Make maps people want to look at!**]

A good Map gives the user access to the data that is not readily available in the table. GIS answers questions that only spatial analysis can!

(It also should keep their eyes from rolling back in their heads as they drift off to a happy place!)
