# Motivating example


Consider a study on the retention of information to children age 4 to which we read a story two hours after the reading.

We expect the ending (happy/sad/neutral) and the complexity (easy/average/hard) to impact their retention.

# Why factorial designs?

To study the impact of story complexity and ending, we could run a series of one-way ANOVA.

Factorial designs are more efficient: can study the impact of multiple variables simultaneously with **fewer overall observations**.

???

To study each interaction (complexity, story book ending) we would need to make three group for each comparison in rows, and one in each column. So a total of 6 one-way ANOVA each with 3 groups

---
class: title title-4

# Estimates

- **Factorial design**: study with multiple factors (subgroups)
- **simple effects**: difference between levels of one in a fixed combination of others (change in difficulty for happy ending)
- **main effects**: differences relative to average for each condition of a factor (happy vs neutral vs sad ending)
- **interaction effects**: when simple effects differ depending on levels of another factor


???

Simple effects are estimates from each ANOVA (either ending or difficulty of story) - so comparisons of cells within a given row or column

Main effects are row/column averages

Interactions effects are difference relative to the row or column average

---
class: title title-4
# Interaction

An interaction is present when the effect of one factor depends on the levels of another factor.

# Formulation of the two-way ANOVA

Two factors: $A$ (complexity) and $B$ (ending) with $a$ and $b$ levels.

Write the average response $Y_{ijk}$ of the $k$th measurement in the group $(A_i, B_j)$ as
$$Y_{ijk} = \mu_{ij} + \varepsilon_{ijk}$$
where 

- $Y_{ijk}$ is the $k$th replicate for $i$th level of factor $A$ and $j$th level of factor $B$
- $\varepsilon_{ijk}$ are independent error terms with mean zero and variance $\sigma^2$.

# Formulation of the two-way ANOVA

Write the model for a response variable $Y$ in terms of two factors $A_i$, $B_j$.

$$Y_{ijk} = \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_j + (\alpha\beta)_{ij} + \varepsilon_{ijk}$$
with the parameters in the sum-to-zero constraints

- $\alpha_i = \mu_{i.} - \mu$
    - mean of level $A_i$ minus overall mean.
- $\beta_j  = \mu_{.j} - \mu$
    - mean of level $B_j$ minus overall mean.
- $(\alpha\beta)_{ij} = \mu_{ij} - \mu_{i.} - \mu_{.j} + \mu$
    - the interaction term for $A_i$ and $B_j$.

???

Specify the sum over any $i$ and $j$ of $(\alpha\beta)_{ij}$ is zero.

class: title title-5
# Sum-to-zero parametrization

The model in terms of $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $(\alpha\beta)$ is overparametrized.

For the sum-to-zero constraint, impose that 

$$\sum_{i=1}^a \alpha_i=0, \quad \sum_{j=1}^b \beta_j=0, \quad  \sum_{j=1}^b (\alpha\beta)_{ij}=0, \quad \sum_{i=1}^a (\alpha\beta)_{ij}=0.$$

which imposes $1 +  a + b$ constraints.

# Testing hypothesis of interest

We only tests hypothesis that are of interest

- If there is a significant interaction, the marginal means are **not** of interest
- Rather, compute the simple effects.
- What is the number of hypothesis of interest? Often, this is pairwise comparisons within each level of the other factor
    - much less than $\binom{ab}{2}$ pairwise comparisons
- Scheffé's method for all custom contrasts still applicable, but may be conservative
- Tukey's method also continues to hold (or generalization thereof)
- Omnibus procedures for controlling the FWER  (Holm-Bonferroni) may be more powerful.

# Omitting terms in a factorial design

The more levels and factors, the more parameters to estimate (and replications needed)
- Costly to get enough observations / power
- The assumption of normality becomes more critical when $r=2$!

It may be useful not to consider some interactions if they are known or (strongly) suspected not to be present

- If important interactions are omitted from the model, biased estimates/output!

# Guidelines for the interpretation of effects

Start with the most complicated term (top down)

- If the three-way interaction $ABC$ is significative:
   - don't interpret main effects or two-way interactions!
   - comparison is done cell by cell within each level
- If the $ABC$ term isn't significative:
	- can marginalize and interpret lower order terms

.box-inv-5[Analytical comparisons]

- Preplanned
- *Post-hoc*: after seeing that the three-way interaction isn't significative, compare all pairwise differences within two-way.

# What contrasts are of interest?

- Can view a three-way ANOVA as a series of one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVAs...

Depending on the goal, could compare for variable $A$
- marginal contrast $\psi_A$ (averaging over $B$ and $C$)
- marginal conditional contrast for particular subgroup: $\psi_A$ within $c_1$
- contrast involving two variables: $\psi_{AB}$
- contrast differences between treatment at $\psi_A \times B$, averaging over $C$.
- etc.

See [helper code](https://edsm.rbind.io/examples/example_threewayanova_contrasts.R) and chapter 22 of Keppel & Wickens (2004) for a detailed example.

# Effects and contrasts for microwave-popcorn

Following preplanned comparisons

- Which combo (brand, power, time) gives highest popping rate? (pairwise comparisons of all combos)
- Best brand overall (marginal means marginalizing over power and time, assuming no interaction)
- Effect of time and power on percentage of popped kernels 
   - pairwise comparison of time $\times$ power
   - main effect of power
   - main effect of time

# Preplanned comparisons using `emmeans`


Let $A$=brand, $B$=power, $C$=time

Compare difference between percentage of popped kernels for 4.5 versus 5 minutes, for brands 1 and 2

$$\mathscr{H}_0: (\mu_{1.2} -\mu_{1.3}) - (\mu_{2.2} - \mu_{2.3}) = 0$$

.small[
```{r plannedcomparisonspopcorn, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(emmeans)
# marginal means
emm_popcorn_AC <- emmeans(model, specs = c("brand","time"))
contrast_list <- list(brand12with4.5vs5min = c(0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0, -1, 1,0))
contrast(emm_popcorn_AC,  # marginal mean (no time)
	  method = contrast_list) # list of contrasts
```

```{r Scheffebyhand, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# Scheffé adjustment by hand 
# emmeans is off because of marginalization - 
# could be solved but specifying the 18 dim vector for contrast...
Scrit <- sqrt(17*qf(0.99, 17, 18)) # 18 cells, but all in terms of 17 combos of differences
# qf() is 99% quantile of F distribution 
# with 17 df and 18 df=(degrees of freedom of residual, 36 obs - 18 param)

# Preplanned comparisons


At level 99% with Tukey's method, compare all three times (4, 4.5 and 5 minutes)

- Careful! Potentially misleading because there is a `brand * time` interaction present.

```{r plannedcomparisons2popcorn, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# List of variables to keep go in `specs`: keep only time
emm_popcorn_C <- emmeans(model, specs = "time")
pairs(emm_popcorn_C, adjust = "tukey", level = 0.99, infer = TRUE)

```
