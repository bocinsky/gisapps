    "text": "Task 1: Hypothesis testing\nWe consider the hypothesis test performed by Bastian et al. (2014) with the data they collected in their Experiment 1. The R and SPSS files containing code for performing the testing procedures and extracting the output are provided. You can also download the SPSS data file and the paper via OpenStats Lab.\n\nBriefly comment on the generalisability of the study in light of the sample composition and data collection.\nThe authors used a two-sample t-test to assess the hypothesis that people in the pain condition felt more threatened by the tasks (a manipulation check). One criticism of using such a test statistic is that it assumes that observations in both group have potentially different group average, but similar standard deviation.1 An alternative test which doesn’t assume equal variance in each experimental condition is Welch’s t-test. Use the latter instead to model the manipulation check for threat and report the output. Do the conclusions change?\nThe authors report results based on a one-way analysis of variance, a testing procedure that compares the mean of \\(m\\) different groups. The latter is equivalent to a two-sample t-test when there are only \\(m=2\\) groups.\n\nUsing the two-sample t-test, obtain a 95% and a 99% confidence interval for the mean difference score for perceived bonding.\nExplain how the two methods (p-value and confidence intervals) are equivalent for performing an hypothesis test with a significance level of 5% and 1%, respectively. Report the conclusions of your procedure in each case.\nList an advantage of each over the other.\n\nExtract the degrees of freedom, the value of the \\(F\\)-statistic and the p-value, suitably rounded and report these.\nWhat can we reasonably conclude about the effect of bonding based on the output of the testing procedure? Is this reflected in the writing of the authors?\nFigure 1 of Bastian et al. (2014) shows a dynamite plot, i.e., a bar plot with 95% confidence intervals for each condition. Note that this is standard display, but overall it is poor graphical choice (why?). Briefly summarize the blog post.\n\n\n\nTask 2 - Reproducibility\nSection 3.2 of Duke & Amir (2022) report the results of an online experiment (Experiment 1) and the impact on sales of sequential vs integrated decision making; the data can be found in the R package hecedsm under DA22_E1; you can also download the SPSS database.\nReproduce the results reported in Section 3.2.2 and check that your results match those of the paper.

(2018) on bank tellers: 100 tellers were offered one-on-one training with an experienced clerk for a certain number of weeks on the job, possibly in addition to formal training period. The goal of the study is to determine which combination is most efficient at reducing the monthly error in balance (in dollars). You can access these data directly from R from the hecedsm package or download the SPSS data.\nDownload and answer the following questions. Write a report as if you were doing an analysis for a scientific publication.\n\nProduce a plot of the monthly error per teller as a function of the number of weeks of one-on-one training.\nProduce a quantile-quantile plot of the residuals and use Levene’s test to check whether the variance in each subgroup is the same. Report on these preliminary checks.\nAssess whether there an interaction between number of weeks of one-on-one training and the formal training using an hypothesis test.\nCompute pairwise contrasts between weeks of one-on-one supervision for the case of people with formal training.\nCompare the difference in errors between 8 and 4 weeks of one-to-one supervision, for people with and without formal training.\n\nHint: to create a pretty interaction plot in R, try the following:\n\n# Redownload the package to get the data\n# remotes::install_github(\"lbelzile/hecedsm\")\ndata(teller, package = \"hecedsm\")\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nteller |&gt; \n  group_by(course, nweeks) |&gt;\n  summarize(merror = mean(error)) |&gt;\n ggplot(aes(x = nweeks,\n            y = merror,\n            group = course,\n            color = course)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_classic() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") + \n  labs(y = \"\",\n       subtitle = \"average monthly error (USD)\",\n       x = \"number of weeks of 1-1 training\")\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBerger, P.

    "section": "",
    "text": "You will do all of your work in this class with the open source (and free!) R programming language. You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.\n\nInstall R\nFirst you need to install the latest version of R itself (the engine), currently 4.3.2 (Eye Holes).\n\nGo to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) website: https://cran.r-project.org/\nClick on “Download R for XXX”, where XXX is either Mac or Windows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use macOS, scroll down to the first .pkg file in the list of files and download it.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use Windows, click “base” (or click on the bolded “install R for the first time” link) and download it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble click on the downloaded file (check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\nInstall OS specific programs\n\n\nmacOS only: download and install XQuartz.\nWindows only: download and install Rtools\n\n\n\nInstall RStudio\nNext, you need to install RStudio, the nicer graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won’t ever have to interact with it directly.\n\nGo to the free download location on RStudio’s website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\nThe website should automatically detect your operating system (Linux, macOS or Windows) and show a big download button for it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n\nDouble click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).\n\n\nInstall tidyverse\nR packages are easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on “Install,” type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can sometimes be tedious when you’re installing lots of packages, though. The tidyverse, for instance, consists of dozens of packages (including ggplot2) that all work together. Rather than install each individually, you can install a single magical package and get them all at the same time.\nGo to the packages panel in RStudio, click on “Install,” type “tidyverse”, and press enter. You’ll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages are installed.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice also that RStudio will generate a line of code for you and run it: install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). You can also just paste and run this instead of using the packages panel.\n\n\nInstall tinytex\nWhen you knit to PDF, R uses a special scientific typesetting program named LaTeX, which is complicated and a large download. To make life easier, there’s an R package named tinytex that installs a minimal LaTeX program and that automatically deals with differences between macOS and Windows.\nTo install tinytex:\n\nUse the Packages in panel in RStudio to install tinytex like you did above with tidyverse. Alternatively, run install.packages(\"tinytex\") in the console.\nRun tinytex::install_tinytex() in the console.\nWait for a bit while R downloads and installs everything you need.\nYou should now be able to knit to PDF.",
