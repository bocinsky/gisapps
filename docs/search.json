You are welcome to use your own computers for the labs if you’d like, but beware as your mileage may vary. I’ve prepared installation instructions for Windows, MacOS (Apple Silicon), and MacOS (Intel), and the course instructors will be available during the lab section on Thursday, January 18 to troubleshoot getting it up and running on your computers. Access to ArcPro is provided at no cost to students. Be mindful of the ArcPro system requirements, but note my instructions on how to get it up and running on MacOS.\nStudents are welcome to attempt to do the labs using alternative software, such as QGIS, R, or Python. You won’t be graded on the software you use, only on the quality of your writeup and results. The course instructors will try to advise and assist with other software as best they can."

The Classes/GISApps folder is by far the easiest place to store your ArcPro data while in this class.\nThe Classes folder will automatically map for everyone in the Stone Hall labs as the “T:\\\\” drive. However, if you need to access the drive from the library or another location on campus, you need to follow the instructions below to map the Classes drive. You need to be connected to ethernet on campus, or eduroam wifi to access the Classes folder.\nDrive mapping instructions: https://umtqsg.atlassian.net/l/cp/Pp2Vgu2M\n\nServer and Share name for Windows: \\\\data.cfc.umt.edu\\Classes$\nsmb://data.cfc.umt.edu/Classes$ for MacOS (available via the Finder menu bar → Go → Connect to Server…)\nUsername: first.last@umt.edu and your normal password\n\nThat will take you to the root of the classes folder, you can see some instructions for signing into available software and general lab info in the root of that folder. Your folder is GISApps and within that, you will see a Labs folder and a Students folder. Labs is intended to store materials/data that that we will share with you prior to the labs. Students will contain a folder for each student in our class where you can store whatever they want/need and is named with your NetID. The only folder students may view or modify is their own folder. The Labs folder is read only for students.\n\n\nFlash Drive (optional)\nA thumb-drive or external hard drive with at least 4 GB of space may prove useful.\nPro tip: Create a Word doc on the drive called “1st Owner Information.” Use the number one in the title and it will always be on top in the file list. Type up all you contact information so when you lose your drive it can be returned."

    "section": "Expectations",
    "text": "Expectations\n\nEmails\nOn a daily basis, I receive 40–50 emails that are related to the work that I do for the university. I often spend several hours a day reading and responding to emails. Before emailing me, please read the syllabus to see if your question is answered in the syllabus. Try to ask assignment questions in class when I ask if there are any questions. For questions you may not want to ask in front of the whole class, you may speak to me after class. If none of those options will work, please email me or see me during student hours.\nWhen emailing, please compose a polite, concise email from your UM email address with a clear subject line. This will ensure that your email isn’t inadvertently sent to my junk mail.\nAll professors and TAs are only expected to respond to emails during working hours and business days, and generally within two business days. Don’t expect responses on the weekends. If I don’t get back to you within 2 business days, please email me again.\n\n\nClassroom Participation\nStudents are expected to attend all classes in person unless they have communicated a reason for absence with the instructor—if you are going to miss class, please communicate that to me ahead of time. Students are individually responsible for all information presented in lectures, Voices of GIS interviews, assigned readings, and class assignments. Classroom participation will be assessed via attendance, attention, pop-quizzes, and active participation in group-discussions. There will be several unannounced reading and participation quizzes. Combined, these quizzes and your participation total 10 percent of your grade. Thus, consistent attendance and regularly doing the readings are required to do well in the course.\n\nCultural Leave Policy\nCultural or ceremonial leave allows excused absences for cultural, religious, and ceremonial purposes to meet the student’s customs and traditions or to participate in related activities. To receive an authorized absence for a cultural, religious or ceremonial event the student or their advisor (proxy) must submit a formal written request to the instructor. This must include a brief description (with inclusive dates) of the cultural event or ceremony and the importance of the student’s attendance or participation. Authorization for the absence is subject to approval by the instructor. Appeals may be made to the Chair, Dean or Provost. The excused absence or leave may not exceed five academic calendar days (not including weekends or holidays). Students remain responsible for completion or make-up of assignments as defined in the syllabus, at the discretion of the instructor.\n\n\nFamily Policy\nUM does not have an official family policy, so the following guidelines reflect my own beliefs and commitments towards parent students2\n\nBabies are welcome in class as often as necessary for support feeding relationship.\nYou are welcome to bring your child to class in order to cover unforeseeable gaps in childcare.\nIf you come with babies or toddler, I ask that you sit close to the door so that, in case your little one needs special attention and is disrupting the learning of other students, you may step outside of class until their needs are met. Seats close to the door are reserved for parents attending class with their child.\n\n\n\n\nLate Assignments and Exams\nThe lab write-ups and assignments due in class on the day indicated in the assignment description, generally the Thursday of the following week. Late lab write-ups or other assignments will not be accepted. If you anticipate problems with any deadlines, talk with or notify me prior to missing an assignment or exam. Make-up exams will only be given in the rarest of circumstances.\n\n\nClassroom Etiquette\nAs a learning community, it is important for us to work together to ensure that we are fostering a positive and respectful learning environment for all. Below are some selected guidelines.\n\nPlease ensure that you are prepared for class by doing the assignments, having supplies in hand, and being prepared to learn and participate.\nNote-taking with devices (e.g. laptops, iPads) is allowed, but please stay on task. Doing other homework, checking your Reddit, Snapchat, Tik Tok, stocks, the UM basketball score, or anything else not related to the class is not only distracting to you but also to your neighbors.\nPlease be considerate about your food choices, especially those that are noisy or particularly odorous. Coffee is encouraged.\nUnless we are doing group work, please do not carry on private conversations with others.\nWhile I do want you to enjoy this course, please be respectful and act professionally towards your colleagues and me.\nPlease do not text while I am lecturing. Why? It is really distracting to me.\n\n\n\nDisruptive Behavior\nFaculty members at the University of Montana have the independent authority to exclude a student from any class session in which the student displays disruptive behavior that threatens the learning environment and/or safety and well-being of others in the classroom.\n\nIf circumstances warrant dismissal from a class session for behavior reasons, the faculty member should contact the Student Conduct Officer immediately following the class to discuss the situation and make a determination about whether Student Conduct Code charges will be initiated.\nThe student remains eligible to return to the next class session.\nThe faculty member maintains the authority to remove the student from any future class session during which the student is disruptive.\nThe student may be suspended permanently from a class upon recommendation of the Dean of the college or school offering the class in accordance with the disciplinary procedures outlined in the Article V: Proscribed General Conduct section of the Student Conduct Code.\n\n\n\nAcademic Conduct\nFor a full list of regulations and procedures please see the Student Conduct Code.\nStudents at the University of Montana are expected to practice academic honesty at all times. Academic misconduct is subject to academic penalties by the course instructor and/or University sanctions by the University through the Provost and Vice Provost for Academic Affairs.\nAcademic misconduct is defined as all forms of academic dishonesty, including but not limited to:\n\nPlagiarism: Representing another person’s words, ideas, data, or materials as one’s own.\nMisconduct during an examination or academic exercise: Copying from another student’s paper, consulting unauthorized material, giving information to another student, collaborating with one or more students without authorization, or otherwise failing to abide by the University or instructor’s rules governing the examination or academic exercise without the instructor’s permission.\nUnauthorized possession of examination or other course materials: Acquiring or possessing an examination or other course materials without authorization by the instructor.\nTampering with course materials: Destroying, hiding, or otherwise tampering with source materials, library materials, laboratory materials, computer equipment or programs, or other course materials.\nSubmitting false information: Knowingly submitting false, altered, or invented information, data, quotations, citations, or documentation in connection with an academic exercise.\nSubmitting work previously presented in another course: Knowingly making such submission in violation of stated course requirements.\nImproperly influencing conduct: Acting calculatedly to influence an instructor to assign a grade other than the grade actually earned.\nSubstituting, or arranging substitution, for another student during an examination or other academic exercise: Knowingly allowing others to offer one’s work as their own.\nFacilitating academic dishonesty: Knowingly helping or attempting to help another person commit an act of academic dishonesty, including assistance in an arrangement whereby any work, classroom performance, examination activity, or other academic exercise is submitted or performed by a person other than the student under whose name the work is submitted or performed.\nAltering transcripts, grades, examinations, or other academically related documents: Falsifying, tampering with, or misrepresenting a transcript, other academic records, or any material relevant to academic performance, enrollment, or admission, or causing falsification or misrepresentation of any of the above.\n\n\nPenalties for academic misconduct\nDepending on the severity of the academic misconduct, a student may incur one or more of the following penalties:\n\nAcademic Penalty(ies) by the Course Instructor: The student may receive a failing or reduced grade in an academic exercise, examination, or course, and/or be assigned additional work which may include re-examination.\nUniversity Sanction(s): The University may also impose a sanction that exceeds the academic penalty. Sanctions (c) through (f) require administrative review and approval by the Provost and Vice Provost for Academic Affairs:\n\n\nDisciplinary Warning: The student is warned that further misconduct may result in more severe disciplinary sanctions.\nDisciplinary Probation: The student is warned that further misconduct may result in suspension or expulsion. Conditions may be placed on continued enrollment for a specified period of time.\nSuspension: The student is separated from the University for a specified period of time and may also be excluded from participation in any University-sponsored activity.\nExpulsion: The student is permanently separated from the University and may also be excluded from any University-owned and/or -controlled property or events.\nDenial of a Degree: A degree is not awarded.\nRevocation of a Degree: A previously awarded degree is rescinded.\n\n\n\nA Note on GenerativeAI\nUM does not currently have a specific policy on the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI), as this is a new and rapidly developing technology. As such, I reviewed emerging guidance on the use of AI in courses such as this one. I’ve adapted the following statement from a resource at North Carolina State University. Most of the text was adapted from a conversation with the AI tool Bing Chat (powered by GPT-4).\nThis course permits you to use AI tools, such as chatbots, text generators, paraphrasers, summarizers, or solvers, to get guidance on assignments, as long as you do so in an ethical and responsible manner. Essentially, you can think of these tools as ways to help you learn (and to problem-solve particular ArcGIS tasks) but not to entirely create text for assignments like labs, final projects, discussion wuestions. AI is more like your tutor or TA, not a replacement for your independent thinking.\nThis means that you must:\n\nNot use AI tools to replace your own thinking or analysis or to avoid engaging with the course content.\nCite or explain any AI tools you use. Provide the name of the AI tool, the date of access, the URL of the interface, and the specific prompt or query you used to generate the output. This is especially critical for any creative solution you come across.\nBe transparent and honest about how you used the AI tool and how it contributed to your assignment. Explain what you learned from the AI tool, how you verified its accuracy and reliability, how you integrated its output with your own work, and how you acknowledged its limitations and biases.\n\nYou are accountable for any mistakes or errors made by the AI tool. Do not rely on the AI tool to produce flawless or correct results. Always check and edit the output before submitting your work. If you discover any inaccuracies or inconsistencies in the output after submission, notify the instructor immediately and correct them as soon as possible.\nUsing AI tools in an unethical or irresponsible manner, such as copying or paraphrasing the output without citation or transparency, using the output as your own work without verification or integration, or using the output to misrepresent your knowledge or skills, is considered a form of academic dishonesty and will result in a zero grade for the assignment and possible disciplinary action. If you have any questions about what constitutes ethical and responsible use of AI tools, please consult with the instructor before submitting your work.\nAlso, please remember that AI tools are only as unbiased as the data they are trained on. If the training data for the AI includes bias, the results generated by the AI will also be biased. In this way, AI tools can perpetuate the biases present in their original training sets, leading to discrimination against certain groups of people and reinforcing pre-existing inequalities and stereotypes. I encourage you to reflect on the limitations and potential biases of AI-generated content and to use it responsibly."

ESRI ArcGIS StoryMaps allow the cartographer to guide a reader through a map, building a story from map elements and weaving in other media, including photographs, video, and audio. There are many examples of engaging StoryMaps, including wildfire briefings, ecological restoration, Native languages, climate change, and many others.\nIn this lab, you will get an introduction to ArcGIS StoryMaps, and move through the steps required to create your own StoryMap, including preparing data, uploading it to ArcGIS Online, creating a StoryMap, and adding design elements. As you move through the tutorials, take note of specific design elements that you like and that might be appropriate for the StoryMap you are developing for your final project. Be sure to check out the Anatomy of a Story StoryMap cheat sheet for great tips.",

    "text": "Requirements\n\nPart 1: Get started with ArcGIS StoryMaps (30 minutes)\nYour first task is to complete the Get started with ArcGIS StoryMaps tutorial. This will introduce you to the elements of an ArcGIS StoryMap, and get you comfortable with working in ArcGIS Online and the StoryMap Builder.\nIn the last step, Publish and Share, please share your map with the Applications of GIS — Spring 2024 group that you should already be a member of.\nSharing your results or discoveries is essential for demonstrating the value of any research effort. But communication can be tricky, especially if you’re trying to connect with people who aren’t experts in your area of study. The key to success is keeping your audience interested from start to finish. In this tutorial, you’ll use the ArcGIS StoryMaps builder to tell the story of a National Geographic expedition undertaken by three researchers. The combination of text, images, and maps creates a multimedia experience that is entertaining to read. You’ll start by looking at a great example: a story about an expedition in Guatemala. Then, you’ll use that as reference point to learn how to use ArcGIS StoryMaps.\n\n\nPart 2: Map the impact of housing shortage on oil workers (90 minutes)\nNow it is time to dive in a bit more. Complete the Map the impact of housing shortage on oil workers tutorial. This tutorial will require you to gather and prepare data on homelessness, publish those data on ArcGIS Online, create a series of web maps for use in your StoryMap, and share the results through an ArcGIS StoryMap.\nFrom 2012 to 2013, North Dakota’s oil boom attracted thousands of new workers from across the continent seeking well-paying jobs. The state was historically not a densely populated area and did not have enough permanent or even temporary housing to accommodate the rapid influx of workers. As a result, the state experienced a rapid increase in the unhoused population, prompting the local government to reevaluate resource allocation and seek funding opportunities to support the growing vulnerable community. In this tutorial, you’re a GIS specialist documenting the crisis so government officials can prioritize resources to support people experiencing homelessness.\nThe final step is to publish your story. In the final step, please set your sharing level to “Organization” and share your map with the Applications of GIS — Spring 2024 group that you should already be a member of.",

    "section": "Description",
    "text": "Description\nBy now you should be starting to get comfortable with using ArcGIS Pro, so now it is time to start doing some spatial analysis. Using spatial analysis, GIS data can be used to answer geographic questions. For example, this map uses disease spread theory to predict the most dangerous places during a zombie apocalypse. Perhaps more practically, you could use your GIS skills to determine which areas of the U.S. you would most like to live. Consider what criteria you believe are most important for a happy and satisfying life. For example, you may wish to live a place that is not too rainy, doesn’t have too many people, and is in the mountains. How could you make a map that shows just the places that meet these criteria? One way would be to find data layers for each of those criteria, define a selection query for the attributes you want, and then intersect the layers by your selections. For the example above, the final polygons could represent areas of lightly populated temperate forests with under 30 cm of rain a year. Then you would simply select cities within those polygons.\nWhat if you weren’t satisfied with the results? You would have to start over with new selections. However, ArcGIS Pro has a tool which would allow you to quickly change parameters and run the analysis again. Model Builder is a GUI interface for combining a series of tools using flow-chart logic. Models can vastly reduce time spent on repetitive tasks and help troubleshoot errors through iteration. Just about every tool found in the Arc Toolbox can be added and run in Model Builder. There is also functionality for batch processing and iteration, which opens the door to automate tasks on entire geodatabases of files. All models are stored in a project toolbox, and can be modified during editing, or opened after chosen parameters are set. Finished Models can also be exported to Python, providing a gateway to writing scripts.\nFor this lab we are providing you with several different datasets. Average rainfall, average income, population density, biomes and education levels. Your task is to find an additional dataset (we will discuss where to look for data in class) to conduct an analysis of the continental U.S. in order to determine the cities you consider most livable. Use the data to create a custom map of your “ideal” places. Use model builder as demonstrated to run your analysis and plan on fine tuning the model with multiple iterations. You already have the skills needed to for this lab, but we will discuss possible workflows in class.",

This write-up is worth 100 points and will be graded as Excellent (100), Good (80), Fair (60), or Poor (40).\nPlease write a partial scientific report about your analysis of your personal city happiness index. Remember your research question and use your results to answer it. For this assignment, write just the Introduction, Results, and Discussion sections. Write the lab up in a report following the Scientific Report Template discussed in class. Please use the template. Copy and paste your data into the template; it is easier than rebuilding it from scratch. Insert the images of your maps, one to a page, full-size, rotated with the north to the left margin for landscape format images. This partial scientific report does not require the Literature Review, Methods, Conclusion, or Reference sections. Keep the Title page and Contents from the Template, but delete the sections you do not need.\nThe Introduction section is for briefly describing what you intend to do. Summarize the purpose of the analysis, your methods, and give a brief overview of the rest of the report.\nThe Results section is for displaying the model and maps. Insert a screenshot of your final model, and describe the tools used in your model, as well as the steps taken. Insert your final map (or maps). Describe what they show, but do not try to interpret them. Remember, in this section you do not have to analyze the results or add your interpretation. Just describe what the maps show, calling out key areas of interest for the audience.\nThe Discussion section is where you interpret what you found in the maps. What were the top cities or towns in your analysis? How did changing the parameters affect which places rose to the top of the list? How might you go about adapting this analysis to the results of a survey of UM undergraduate students about what factors they find most important when choosing a place to live?\nThis is meant to be a (partial) scientific report, and to give you some room to practice scientific writing. Please be neat, organized, and professional. Spelling and grammar count. Please try to avoid using the passive voice. Many people incorrectly assume passive voice makes scientific writing sound more authoritative. This is wrong; use of the passive voice can make your writing less clear and engaging. You are welcome to use the first-person active voice in your write-up (e.g., “I use the model builder to …”). There is no absolute number of pages required. Just use what it takes to cover the material: your introduction, results, and discussion.\nPlease save your lab write-up as a Microsoft Word or PDF document. Give your lab write-up a file name in this format:\n\n[last name]_lab-1.[format]\n\nFor example, my lab write-up would be Bocinsky_lab-1.docx or Bocinsky_lab-1.pdf.",

    "text": "A semester-long assignment, the group GIS project requires you to identify a unique resource management problem or environmental planning challenge that can be answered with a GIS analysis, design and run the analysis, and tell the story of that analysis using an ESRI StoryMap. Each group must submit a project proposal following a format that will be discussed in class. As a group, you will develop a research question, review the literature or documentation about your subject area (including, perhaps, techniques have been applied previously), decide what data is required, and design and complete your analysis. You will document your analysis in an ArcGIS StoryMap, and compile all of your project resources in an ArcGIS Pro Package. Your StoryMap should include maps, graphs, tables, and figures that support your research and its results. The project design, workflow and conclusions will be presented to the class at the end of the semester, and archived as part of our ArcGIS Online group.\nThe purpose of this project is twofold. First and foremost, it is to practice how to design, organize, and execute a research project within the ArcGIS ecosystem, and communicate it in an attractive and interactive format. You should leverage the skills you’ve learned in this course and others to address a real-world challenge, of the sort that you will engage in as a GIS professional. The second is to continue to practice engaging in group-based work. Group work is hard, but I truly believe it is among the most important professional skills to develop. This project will afford you the opportunity to consider your strengths — design, analysis, data cleaning, writing, presentation — and hopefully complement the strengths of others in your group in order to successfully execute your project.",

The scope of the project proposal is to introduce your final project, explain the research question and approach, set the research within a contextual framework, and cover some preliminary methods.\nPlease use the following format including these sections:\n\nIntroduction (~250–500 words)\nProblem Statement (~500 words)\nContextual Framework (Literature Review; ~500–1000 words)\nProposed Methods (~250–500 words)\n\nThe introduction explains the project purpose and gives a short background to the site and setting of the geography. The problem statement outlines the research question or planning challenge and how you intend to answer it. Use the contextual framework to review at least three pieces of literature that ground the research in demonstrated science, or reference at least three examples of how your particular planning challenge has been addressed in other contexts. Finally, describe the proposed methods with an outline of the data, the GIS tools you may use on the data, and the GIS steps that could be followed in the analysis.1\nSee the provided example of a project proposal and use its format.2 There is no firm length for the project proposal, however, the more you write here, the further ahead you are for the final StoryMap — much of the text may be re-used in your StoryMap. Try to follow the length guidelines above, plus the title page and references.\nYour group Project Proposal is due by 11:59 PM on Monday, April 1.\n\n\nFinal Group StoryMap\nYour group is tasked with using GIS analysis to address an environmental challenge or explore a specific problem. Rather than a traditional research paper, you will create an ESRI StoryMap to present your analysis, findings, and solutions in an engaging and visually appealing format.\n\nComponents\nThe final group StoryMap has two components: an ArcGIS Pro Project in which you will archive all databases, toolboxes, and maps for your project, and an ArcGIS StoryMap that you will use to communicate the process and results of your project.\n\nArcGIS Pro Project Package and ArcGIS Online Maps\nAll databases, toolboxes, and maps for your project should be stored in an ArcGIS Pro Project. Work with the course instructor to get access to a shared file space on the T:/ drive in which to start your project. There are other ways to share data and information using ArcGIS Online that you are free to explore; however, at the end of the project, you will need to encapsulate your project in an ArcGIS Pro Package, and upload it to the class ArcGIS Online group.\nDocument all raw data sets used in your project, and keep the raw data as part of your project. Describe where you got your data (i.e., from what authority?) and document any manipulations you made to the data, including re-projection. View and edit the metadata for your raw and derived data sets.3 While it isn’t mandatory, I strongly encourage you to use the ModelBuilder or a script to design and run your analysis. If you do, you may screen-shot and annotate your model as an illustration of your workflow.\nYou will likely need to upload your maps to ArcGIS Online for use in your ArcGIS StoryMap. Please label your maps with a consistent naming convention that clearly indicates your group’s project.\n\n\nESRI StoryMap\nDevelop an ESRI StoryMap that reports on your analysis and results. You are welcome to use edited text from your proposal, but the StoryMap should elaborate on and refine the proposal text. Use images, maps, and other graphics throughout to create an engaging and attractive presentation of your project.\nThere are lots of resources on the ArcGIS StoryMaps website, but two very helpful ones are the getting started guide and the Planning and outlining your story guide.\nPlease include the following sections in your StoryMap. You may use various StoryMap display elements for the sections (e.g., immersives, panels, slide shows), but all the sections need to be represented adequately.\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nBriefly introduce the chosen environmental problem.\nClearly state the research question or objective.\nProvide context on the significance of using GIS for analysis.\n\n\nContextual Framework (Literature Review)\n\n\nSummarize relevant literature on the environmental problem and GIS techniques.\nHighlight key findings from previous studies.\nJustify the chosen research question based on literature.\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nDetail the GIS analysis methods employed.\nDescribe data collection, processing, and analysis.\nUse visuals (flowcharts or diagrams) for clarity.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nShowcase results through maps, graphs, tables, and figures.\nClearly label and explain each visual element.\nProvide multiple layers of maps if applicable.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\nInterpret results in the context of the research question.\nDiscuss challenges faced and how your group addressed them.\nCompare findings to existing literature.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nSummarize main findings of the analysis.\nState implications of results for addressing the environmental problem.\nPropose recommendations or suggestions for future research/actions.\n\n\nCredits and Contributions\n\n\nList anyone (including organizations) that were particularly helpful to you.\nList the contributions of your team members. Include categories of contributions such as “designed the analysis”, “cleaned the data”, “developed map styles”, “developed the StoryMap”, etc. Consider using the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT) if appropriate.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nAll sources—for maps, data, images, and references—should be cited in your StoryMap.\nYou may style citations however you like, but be consistent.\nESRI’s guide for Citations and references for sources in ArcGIS StoryMaps may be helpful.\nCheck out Citing Sources in a Storymap for inspiration and tips on citations in StoryMaps.\n\n\n\n\nSubmission\nUpload your final ArcGIS StoryMap and ArcGIS Pro Project Package to the class ArcGIS Online group. Your final group StoryMap is due by 11:59 PM on Monday, April 29.\n\n\n\nStoryMap Presentation\nDuring the last week of class, your group will give a brief demo of your StoryMap.

He earned his BS in Biochemistry and Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine from Oklahoma State University and was a practicing veterinarian for nearly 10 years in Oklahoma before going back to school to earn his PhD in molecular epidemiology from Louisiana State University in 1999. As a Postdoctoral Fellow and Assistant Research Professor at Northern Arizona University, Dr. Smith developed programs and conducted research in human and agricultural infectious disease ecology, molecular typing methods, and the application of molecular epidemiological techniques to forensic investigations. In 2005, Dr. Smith was named as the first Chief Veterinarian for the Department of Homeland Security and Chief Scientist for the Office of Health Affairs. While at DHS, he advised the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Department’s senior leadership on strategies and emergency response plans for food and agricultural security. Dr. Smith set the vision and led the development of the U.S. Government-wide strategy to acquire and analyze biosurveillance information obtained from public and private sector organizations to support national biodefense, biosecurity, food and agricultural security, and health protection programs. Since leaving Washington, Dr. Smith co-founded McCarthy & Smith Consulting, LLC, where he provides professional consulting services in the areas of biosurveillance, bioforensics, biodefense, biosecurity, molecular genetics and diagnostics, and food safety, defense, and security.\nDr. Smith shared a personal history of his work with GIS:\n\n\nMy first introduction to GIS was with an early precision agriculture modelling system for irrigated cotton production called GOSSYM-COMAX. The GIS was mostly hidden within the modeling system.\n\n\n\nI “heads up” digitized 10 years of oyster bed lease closure maps along the Gulf Coast for the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources to help pay my way through graduate school at LSU Baton Rouge. I worked on an old Data General mainframe computer that required extreme air-conditioning to function which required that I wear sweaters in the summertime in South Louisiana.\n\n\n\nI worked in the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Remote Sensing and GIS for Public Health at Louisiana State University.

    "text": "Dr. Kimothy Smith is a veterinarian, spatial epidemiologist, biodefense expert, and entrepreneur. He earned his BS in Biochemistry and Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine from Oklahoma State University and was a practicing veterinarian for nearly 10 years in Oklahoma before going back to school to earn his PhD in molecular epidemiology from Louisiana State University in 1999. As a Postdoctoral Fellow and Assistant Research Professor at Northern Arizona University, Dr. Smith developed programs and conducted research in human and agricultural infectious disease ecology, molecular typing methods, and the application of molecular epidemiological techniques to forensic investigations. In 2005, Dr. Smith was named as the first Chief Veterinarian for the Department of Homeland Security and Chief Scientist for the Office of Health Affairs. While at DHS, he advised the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Department’s senior leadership on strategies and emergency response plans for food and agricultural security. Dr. Smith set the vision and led the development of the U.S. Government-wide strategy to acquire and analyze biosurveillance information obtained from public and private sector organizations to support national biodefense, biosecurity, food and agricultural security, and health protection programs. Since leaving Washington, Dr. Smith co-founded McCarthy & Smith Consulting, LLC, where he provides professional consulting services in the areas of biosurveillance, bioforensics, biodefense, biosecurity, molecular genetics and diagnostics, and food safety, defense, and security.\nDr. Smith shared a personal history of his work with GIS:\n\n\nMy first introduction to GIS was with an early precision agriculture modelling system for irrigated cotton production called GOSSYM-COMAX. The GIS was mostly hidden within the modeling system.\n\n\n\nI “heads up” digitized 10 years of oyster bed lease closure maps along the Gulf Coast for the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources to help pay my way through graduate school at LSU Baton Rouge. I worked on an old Data General mainframe computer that required extreme air-conditioning to function which required that I wear sweaters in the summertime in South Louisiana.\n\n\n\nI worked in the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Remote Sensing and GIS for Public Health at Louisiana State University. During that time, I:\n\nDeveloped a simple GIS for studying Fasciola hepatica (a trematode liver fluke of cattle) as a model for Schistosoma mansoni (infects humans) on the spoil islands off the coast of Louisiana.\nDeveloped a simple GIS for studying translocation outcomes for the Red-cockaded Woodpecker (an endangered species of the Southern United States).\nDeveloped a simple GIS to plot and study growth of saw palmetto in the Kisatchie National Forest.\nDeveloped a working GIS for studying and modeling Bacillus anthracis (causative agent of anthrax) in the Kruger National Park, South Africa.

There will be instructions for each lab that outline the learning objectives and the steps that should be taken to complete the project. Although some steps will be written-up in detail, there will not be explicit instructions for every button-click in the software. The student is responsible for applying the on-screen demonstrations, technique videos, and outside resources that will be introduced by the instructor. Each lab will be documented in a report that follows the standard scientific format. This includes the following sections: Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion and References. We will cover how to write the various sections of the report and build up to a complete paper for the final projects. The maps, tables, and graphs generated in labs are to be used as figures for the reports. Always place maps as large as possible, one to a page, rotated if necessary. A Scientific Report Template will be provided and must be used or points will be deducted. Each lab write-up is worth 100 points.\nThree shorter Map Tutorials will round out your GIS skill set, and/or will serve as an introduction to ArcPro for those of you who have taken past courses using the legacy ArcMap software. Each map tutorial write-up is worth 50 points.\nAll labs and map tutorials will be submitted into separate Microsoft Forms in Microsoft Word or PDF formats only.

    "section": "Description",
    "text": "Description\nThe roots of the word choropleth come from the Greek “choro” — meaning space or place, and “pleth” — meaning multitude, as in a plethora. Therefore, choropleth maps literally display places full of data. This is commonly accomplished by classifying geographic enumeration units and symbolizing those classes with filled regions of progressive of color. As a cartographer, you have control over the analysis, classification, and color choices, but the shape and size of the regions are fixed by geography. Here in lies the inherent problem with choropleth maps. Human perception tends to assign more value to larger size. Unfortunately, data are rarely found with the highest value in the largest space. Smaller areas will be perceived as having less value regardless of the color assigned to the polygon.\nTherefore, it is imperative to NEVER map raw data values using a choropleth map. Some form of normalization must be performed in order to account for the bias described by the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP — look it up). The most common normalization is division by total area of each unit, producing a density measurement. An example would be persons per km². Another common normalization is a proportion that gives the percent of a phenomenon in an area. An example would be percent of college graduates out of total county population. However, this measurement still suffers from the bias of randomly defined enumeration units — but it is better than mapping the raw data.\nTo start this lab, as should be done with any mapping project, first ask, What is the purpose of the maps I am about to make? Of course, the connected question is whom are we making the maps for. So, let’s define a general audience concerned with higher education (people just like you!). In order to make a map that is interesting, always try to answer a spatial question that is not obvious in the data alone. If all you want to show the audience is numbers, give them a table.\nOur purpose here then is to use Census Data from the American Community Survey to explore the claim that education drives the economic health of a region. This is most often tied to the concept of “human capital,” where people with new ideas and skills drive economic growth. One measure of “human capital” is the percentage of educated persons in a city or region. The more educated the populace, the more robust the economy should be. When mapped, we should see regions with a higher percentage of educated people also having a higher average personal income. However, the economists Jacobs and then Lucas argue that it’s not the percentage of educated that matters, but the density of educated people. After all, smart people have to interact in order to produce “human capital.” The main hypotheses states that cities with a high education density will have stronger economies.2\nBecause analyzing all the cities in the US is beyond the scope of a mapping project at this scale, we will apply the concepts above to the county level aggregate. Play with the interactive map below to get a feel for educational attainment. You will make maps looking at both density and percentage of educated workers in US counties, as well as income density and average income. Finally, we will use Geographically Weighted Regression to test whether education percentage, or density, is a greater driver of income.",

    "text": "Requirements\n\nPart 1: Developing the Choropleth\n\nGo to the National Historical Geographical Information System (NHGIS) data website. Click on the Login link in the upper right and follow the instructions to create an account. Back on the homepage, click on the Get Data link beside Start Here. Set the Filters as follows by choosing the selection, and then clicking Submit:\nGeographic Levels: county\nDatasets: 2020 American Community Survey (2016_2020_ACS5a)\nUnder the source tables tab, select the (B01003)Total Population, (B15002)Sex by Educational Attainment for the Population 25 Years and Over, and (B19313)Aggregate Income in the Past 12 Months. Under the GIS files tab, select the 2020 County file with the basis of 2020 Tiger/Line +. Under the Data Cart window in the upper right, click continue. You may see a red prompt that says “One or more tables lack a geographic level selection (see below).” Click on Select Geographic Levels and choose county. Make sure that you have three tables and one GIS file to be downloaded, and then click continue again under the Data Cart in the upper right. Under Table File Structure, select Comma delimited (best for GIS). Check the box to Include additional descriptive header row (best for spreadsheets) and click submit. After a bit, refresh the browser to see if the data is ready. Alternatively, check your email for a data link. Download the combined data table and the GIS County borders layers.\nUnzip the files into a “Raw_Data” folder that you create. Make sure to stay organized by putting the contents of each zip into a named folder (IMPORTANT!!!). You may notice that the shapefile is double zipped and needs to be extracted more than once.\nStart a new ArcPro project, copy the Raw_Data folder into the project folder, and then explore the GIS layer just downloaded to determine the projection. What projection is the data in? What will be the projection for the project? (You are mapping the contiguous United States, so this should sound familiar).\nIn the new GDB, create a Feature Dataset in the appropriate spatial reference for the project (Hint: go with the projection of the original data, which you can import). Load the county borders for the US.\nNow we are going to clean up the data table. Open the .csv table in Excel. The matching .txt file has all the attribute name definitions and is important to study. In the .csv you can delete all the columns that don’t have any data. Use the information in row two to find and delete all the columns related to education attainment of an associate degree or lower for either sex. Delete all the Margins of Error columns. Delete columns AMRYE001, AMRYE002, and AMRYE019. Rename the Estimates: Total (AMPVE001) column to TOTAL_POP in row one. Rename the Estimates: Aggregate income in the past 12 months… (AMTME001) column to TOTAL_INCOME in row one. Keep the GIS Join, State, and County columns, but delete the others that are not related to a bachelor’s or higher education attainment, and that you have not renamed.\nCreate a new column to the left of TOTAL_INCOME and name it TOTAL_EDU. Select all the higher education numbers for both sexes in row three, and then use the AutoSum button on the Formulas tab to sum them into the TOTAL_EDU column. Double-click on the small square on the lower right corner of the formula box in the TOTAL_EDU column to get a sum of all the counties’ education attainment. Copy the TOTAL_EDU column, and then use Paste Special to replace only the values, removing the formulas. You can then delete all the degree columns. Delete the second row with the extra information — you want only one header row with the names for the attribute columns. The final table should look like this (ensure that your numbers match!):\n\n\n\nYour Excel spreadsheet should look like this.\n\n\nPerform a Save As, and name it Edu_Income.csv. ArcGIS Pro should be able to read a .xlsx, but since a .csv always works, stick with that.\nNow set up the map workspace. Insert a new Map Pane and add the counties. It should automatically take on the appropriate equal area projection. Join the raw table you just created to the county layer by the obvious join field (GIS Join). Check the attribute table to make sure the join was successful. Save the project.\nNext, make the join permanent and reduce the dataset to the contiguous US. Using the Select by Attributes tool in the open attribute table, make a selection that includes Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Switch the Selection to get only the contiguous US. Export the selected data (right-click the joined layer → Data → Export Features) into the Feature Dataset and name it Con_US_Join. The original ACS data table is now part of the Con_US_Join attributes. Remove the original counties layer. Then symbolize the data by TOTAL_EDU using Graduated Colors. Is this a valid choropleth map? Why or why not?\nSwitch to the Catalog View, and from the Portal in the Contents Pane, search the Living Atlas for Colleges. The top return should be called Colleges and Universities. Right-click to add them to your map, but remove all the classes besides “Four or more years”. Symbolize with small dots.\nYou now need to calculate the area for each county. Open the Con_US_Join layer attribute table and in the upper left → click Add Field → name it Total_Area → Data Type = double → Number Format = Numeric with 2 decimal places. Then save the change in the upper ribbon. Back in the table, right-click on the header for the new column → Calculate Geometry. Choose the Area property → choose square kilometers under Units → choose Current Map under Coordinate System → then Run.\nCreate two new columns called Percent_Educated and Average_Income. With the Calculate Field tool, derive the values using the formulas below. Now you can create Percent Educated and Average Income maps by inserting a new Map Pane for each one. You could have used the Normalization selection of the Graduated Colors option, but we will need the actual values later. We will also go over choosing the right classification in class next week, but remember that in order to compare these maps, the classification must be as close as possible. \\[{\\text{Percent Educated}} =\\frac{\\text{Total Educated}}{\\text{Total Pop}}\\]\\[\\text{Average Income} =\\frac{\\text{Total Income}}{\\text{Total Pop}}\\] How do they compare? Conventional wisdom says they should look very similar if equally classified and displayed with the same color scheme. Where are the concentrations of “human capital”? Do they match the concentrations of actual capital? How well do the locations of universities correlate with the concentrations? Do you think that not accounting for the differences in geographic area is hiding or highlighting trends in the data? If so, how? (You may get a null for one of these calculations. Feel free to look on the internet, find a number that makes sense and fill it in to fix your nulls being sure to save your edits)\nNow create Education Density and Income Density maps by adding two more fields and calculating them using the formulas below. \\[{\\text{Education Density}} =\\frac{\\text{Total Educated}}{\\text{Total Area}}\\]\\[\\text{Income Density} =\\frac{\\text{Total Income}}{\\text{Total Area}}\\] How do they compare? Are they more similar than the first set? Where are the concentrations of “human capital”? Do they match the concentrations of actual capital? What relationships do the Universities have with the concentrations? Do you think that accounting for the differences in area is hiding or highlight trends in the data? If so, how?\n\nThis is the end of the Part 1. You should have four clean quantitative choropleth maps exploring the relationships between education and income. Once finished, make sure to save them and export the .jpg files at 150 dpi for the report.\nIn Part 2, we will get into some more advanced spatial analysis using the data you have already formatted. Remember our research question: What is the relationship between education and income? Is income more influenced by percent educated people, or the density of educated people? From the work you have completed thus far, what would be your prediction? Write down your thoughts now before you begin Part 2. It is important to have a hypothesis formulated before you are biased by the experimental results! Take a break, find the sun, breath the air!\n\n\nPart 2: GWR Analysis\nTo start part two, let’s review the research question. In part one you mapped both income and higher education by density and percentage. Our question is whether education explains income. As you read, some economists believe that it is the density of educated people that matters, not just the percentage. So, let’s refine the question. Starting with the dependent variable, we would like to know if average income goes up when there are more educated people in society. In other words, is the average personal income dependent on education? And if so, what is more important, the percent of educated, or the density? You are going to use a form of spatial statistics called Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to compare income dependency to both education percentage and density. The analysis takes into consideration spatial relationships of neighbors and tries to fit a regression equation to each enumeration unit. Read the ArcGIS Pro GWR documentation to get a feel for the tools and technique.\n\nThe GWR tool requires that your data be in a projection, not just a geographic coordinate system. This is why we set the Feature Dataset to NAD 1983 Contiguous USA Albers in Part 1. Check the coordinates of your joined county layer and make sure it has the proper projection. Also, make sure you have fields for Average Income, Percent Educated and Education Density in the attribute table. If not, create them —- But I wonder how you made the first four maps?\nYou are going to do many runs of analysis, so stay organized. You will first look at the relationship between Average Income and Percent Educated in the counties. Open the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) tool and set these parameters:\nInput Features: Your Projected Counties Layer\nDependent Variable: Average Income\nModel Type: Continuous (Gaussian)\nExplanatory Variable: Percent Educated\nOutput Feature Class: Name and path to the GDB Feature Dataset (for example, GWR_AvgIncome_PerEdu)\nNeighborhood Type: Number of Neighbors\nNeighborhood Selection Method: Golden Search\nMinimum Number of Neighbors: 30\nMaximum Number of Neighbors: 100\nLeave the Defaults on the other options.\nClick Run. When the tool finishes it will add a Feature Class that shows the Standard Residual classified by standard deviation. If you have adequately explained the dependent variable with the explanatory variable, the residual distribution should be spatially random. It may look like it, but as we know, our eyes can be fooled.\nNow you will check additional results by consulting the model diagnostics. The tool creates a table that can be opened by clicking on the View Details option under the Geoprocessing menu. You can view this Report at any time by going to the Geoprocessing menu bar and clicking History on the far left. Then click the GWR run and scroll down in the pop-up until you can view the messages. Look at these Model Diagnostics values:\nR2 & R2Adj: Closer to 1 is better\nAICs: smaller is better\nSigma Squared: smaller is better\nSigma & Sigma MLE: smaller is better\nEffective Degrees of Freedom: closer to number of features is better\nWhen they say “better”, they mean compared to another GWR run that has the same dependent variable, but different explanatory variables. Both runs may still be “mis-specified”, however, one explains the dependent better. Also, take a look at the charts that were generated and placed in the Contents Pane, especially the relationship between variables.\nNow open the attribute table for the new feature class and look at the column statistics for these values:\nStdErrorINTRCPT (Standard Error): smaller is better\nStdResid (Standard Residual): smaller is better\nCond (Condition Number): Average should be less than 30, smaller is better\nAgain, these are compared to another GWR run that has the same dependent variable.\nSymbolize your GRW run by the Local R2 attribute with 10 classes using the Geometric Interval method. The areas closer to one have a better model fit. Are there clusters of low R-Squared values? What could be causing them; a missing explanatory variable? We usually try to keep the number of choropleth classes between 5–7, but in this case, the values should only fall between 0 and 1. Showing the data in 0.1 steps nicely displays the dispersion or clustering. Manually adjust your classes to 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1. (Can you use a different interval method to accomplish this?) You can then import this symbology to all your GWR maps so they are directly comparable. Make a map of Local R2 for this regression run and export it to a .jpg for the report.\nTo check for a truly random distribution open the Spatial Autocorrelation (Global Moran’s I) tool. Enter these parameters:\nInput Feature Class: output Feature Class from the GWR tool just run (for example, GWR_AvgIncome_PerEdu). Input Field: Local R2 Generate Report: Check Conceptualization of Spatial Relationships: K Nearest Neighbors Standardization: None Number of Neighbors: 30\nClick Run. When it finishes, click on the View Details option under the Geoprocessing menu, find the Report File HTML, and double-click. (This html link is also placed in the project folder.) Examine the results that open in a browser. It will tell you if the Local R2 values are truly random. If they are random, then the explanatory variable has adequately explained the dependent variable, regardless of geography. If the results are clustered, geography is significant in the variable relationship, and the explanatory variable may only be valid in regional areas. They would say this model is mis-specified. If dispersed, the variables are related, but the geography effect is localized. This model is also mis-specified. In other words, dispersed and clustered runs are saying that the relationship is more complex and varies with geography; you have missed an important variable. What could it be? You can view this report at any time by going to the Catalog History and hovering over the Spatial Autocorrelation Tool run. You can also find it in the project folder.\n\nNow you must experiment with different explanatory variables to try and get the best model fit. Start by recreating the exact run you just did, but use Education Density as the explanatory variable. Remember that all the parameters in the tables are related. If one gets smaller, another may get larger. Consult the GWR documentation to gain a deeper understanding of the tools and how to interpret the results.\nThere will be no perfectly fit model, only a compromise. It is also unlikely that you will get a well-fit model using only one explanatory variable. As you get to know the data, experiment with different variable combinations that are logical. Try to create the best model that explains Average Income. Should you include the location of universities as a weighted value? To do so, you would need perform a Spatial Join to the Counties layer first, and then add them to a GRW run as a dependent variable. You need to perform a minimum of four GWR runs to map. They will include the density and percent education explanatory variables, and two others, perhaps the locations of universities or other data you can find that helps explain average income. You can also choose more than one explanatory variable for a single GWR run.",

Remember your research question and use your results to answer it. For this assignment, write just the Introduction, Results, and Discussion sections. Write the lab up in a report following the Scientific Report Template discussed in class. Please use the template. Copy and paste your data into the template; it is easier than rebuilding it from scratch. Insert the images of your maps, one to a page, full-size, rotated with the north to the left margin for landscape format images. This partial scientific report does not require the Literature Review, Methods, Conclusion, or Reference sections. Keep the Title page and Contents from the Template, but delete the sections you do not need.\nThe Introduction section is for briefly describing what you intend to do. Summarize the purpose of the analysis, your methods, and give a brief overview of the rest of the report.\nThe Results section is for displaying the maps. Describe what they show, but do not try to interpret them. Display the original four choropleth maps from Part 1. Also, include four GWR maps including the Percent Edu and Edu Density runs, along with your worst fit model and your best from Part 2. Write about their differences and similarities throughout the Results. Remember, in this section you do not have to analyze the results or add your interpretation. Just describe what the maps show, calling out key areas of interest for your reader.\nThe Discussion section is where you interpret what you found in the maps. Is Average Income driven by Education Density more than Percent Educated? Can education alone even explain income variation? Is the relationship constant from one region to another? How well were you able to get the model to fit? What did you conclude about the relationship between education and income? (It’s complicated!)\nThis is meant to be a (partial) scientific report, and to give you some room to practice scientific writing. Please be neat, organized, and professional. Spelling and grammar count. Please try to avoid using the passive voice. Many people incorrectly assume passive voice makes scientific writing sound more authoritative. This is wrong; use of the passive voice can make your writing less clear and engaging. You are welcome to use the first-person active voice in your write-up (e.g., “I use geographically weighted regression (GWR) to …”). There is no absolute number of pages required. Just use what it takes to cover the material: your introduction, results, and discussion.\nPlease save your lab write-up as a Microsoft Word or PDF document.

    "text": "Description\nAn Isarithmic map is simply one where isolines are of equal value. The most common example is contour maps were each line represents a constant elevation. This technique is very useful for showing the seamless distribution of an attribute over an area. In thematic mapping, isoline maps are used to show temperature, precipitation, air pressure, pollution, etc. The power of this technique lies in the use of interpolation methods to convert point-sampled data into a raster surface that estimates values for all intermediate locations. When classed, the breaks become the lines of equal value. ArcGIS Pro uses several types of interpolation, including Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW), Kriging, Natural Neighbor, Spline, Topo to Raster, and Trend. Each produces different results and is best suited for different types of data. The goal is to choose the method that creates the smoothest surface with the points used. You will experiment to find the best method for this lab.\nA “hot topic” lately, pun intended, is the debate over climate change. To gauge how much temperatures have changed recently, scientists have been very busy trying to use proxies to extend the temperature record back through time. Instrument records cover at best 200 years, and can be spotty, so it is common practice to use temperature data derived from proxies like tree rings, ice cores, pollen, coral and sea floor cores to fill in the gaps. One study, by Guiot and Corona, 2010, created 1400 years of average temperature in Europe for the growing season of April through September. How can we test the validity of this paleoclimate dataset? Using this data, it is possible to create a series of Isarithmic maps to show the anomalies from mean temperature over certain time spans. If we make maps of the Little Ice Age, or the Medieval Warm Period, what should they look like? What does it mean if they don’t match our assumptions? By reading their article and assessing the methods used, you can use your maps to evaluate their results and discuss the climate changes visible in the data.",

Ask yourself how ice core data from Greenland can be used to extrapolate temperature data for Europe in the past? What about tree rings, or grape harvests?\nOn the Europe Temperature Recons sheet, notice that column A has all the information needed for the header. The data needs to be transposed, that is Y swapped for X. The easiest way to do this is as follows:\n\nSelect the first cell (1A) and hit Ctrl + A to select all, then Ctrl + C to copy.\nIn a new Excel workbook, select the first cell.\nUnder Paste → Paste Special → Check Transpose → OK.\nSave the new Excel file and name it Climate_Data.xlsx\n\nChange the long and lati headers to LONG and LAT. Change the VAR header to STATION_ID. Remove the SE and Year AD columns. Notice that there is data from 600 all the way to 2007. A table in ArcGIS Pro has a 256-column limit without some tricky import workarounds. Luckily, we only need this data to create some average columns, and then it can be deleted.\nCreate a new column at the far right with the header named AVG_ALL and format it as a number with 4 decimals. Populate the column using a formula finding the average temperature anomaly from 600 to 2007.\nCreate a formatted column and find the average temperature anomaly from 1961 through 1990. Why is this time span important?\nCreate formatted columns and find the average temperature anomalies for the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age. Conduct some research to figure out what years these periods cover.\nFind the beginning year of the Industrial Revolution (more searching!) and calculate the average temperature anomaly from then to 2007 in another formatted column.\nFinally, calculate the average temperature anomaly for the last decade in the dataset. Will this decade be above or below average?\nNow copy all the derived values (the averages you just created), along with the STATION_ID, LAT and LONG columns. Open another workbook, select the first cell, and under Paste → Paste Special, select Values, and then hit OK. This will get rid of the formulas and reduce the data to just the stations, the coordinates, and the averages you need for analysis. Check the formatting and reset to a 4 decimal number if necessary. Save the spreadsheet, and then perform a Save As to a .csv called Climate_Averages.csv.\nBack in ArcGIS Pro, go to Add Data → XY Point Data and navigate to the Climate_Averages.csv. Make sure the X field is LONG and the Y field is LAT. The Z field should be none. Write the output feature class to your feature dataset in the project GDB named Climate_Pts. Click Run, and you should have the 125 temperature observation points displayed.\nFigure out your projection. I recommend an equal area projection for Europe. Perpaps search on epsg.io and try out a few. Once set, use Zoom to Layer on the climate points so you only have Europe and northern Africa on screen. Then navigate to the Clip Layers tab within the Map Frame properties. From the drop-down, choose Clip to a custom extent, then Current visible extent. Click Apply, then OK. The countries and basemap will be masked to a rectangle.\nSave the project and take a break.\n\n\n\nPart 2: Data Interpolation\n\nReview the class lecture on interpolation and the data sources listed on the Proxies tab in the original spreadsheet. What kind of data you are using here? How was the data created and what kind of interpolation method is best suited to it?\nIn the Spatial Analysis Toolbox, under Interpolation, use the defaults in the Spline tool to create a raster surface of your AVG_ALL points. Choose a color ramp that best suits temperatures above and below an average. Then, run the tool again changing the Spline Type from Regularized to Tension. How do the maps compare?\nNow run a Kriging, Natural Neighbor and IDW interpolation on the AVG_ALL data, experimenting with the default settings. Which method gives you the smoothest surface? Why?\nRemove all but your Spline Regularized run of the AVG_ALL attribute. It should be obvious that the Spline tool is the best choice for this data because it is an evenly spaced grid of interpolated data. Now use the Spline tool to create surfaces for all the temperature anomaly averages that you calculated.\nNext, you must create class breaks that are normalized so we can truthfully compare the maps of temperature anomalies. Look up the Min and Max values for each Isarithmic surface, making a list. There may be lower and higher values than the raw data. Why? Notice that the Last Decade averages have a much higher max temperature. We will have to treat the Last Decade as an outlier, and symbolize it with its own class breaks, or all of the maps will look quite bland. Therefore, only apply the normalized symbolization to the first five Splines. To do this, choose a range that will cover all possible values, and then save class breaks that can be loaded into each spline. For example, I found that a range of -0.6 to +0.6 with 0.1 degree breaks works on my runs. Once you figure out the range, go to the spline run that has the lowest value. Figure out how many classes you need and modify the breaks. Choose a color ramp that fits with temperature above and below a zero point. Now you can normalize all your maps with the same breaks and color ramp by using the Import from Layer function in the Symbology Pane.\nOne last touch that will help users understand your maps is to include a zero-value contour. What will that contour represent? Find the Contour tool, use a Spline run as the Input raster, and save the feature class to the project GDB. When the contour interval is set above the range of data, and the base contour is set to zero, only one contour line will be created at the zero break. Create a zero contour for each of the Spline runs and symbolize it over the appropriate map.\nNow create 6 maps of temperature anomalies in Europe over the different time-spans. All these maps show the anomalies in C° above or below an average temperature. What is that average temperature and where did it come from? What assumption underlies that average temperature? If that assumption is wrong, what consequences would that mistake have on the Guiot and Corona study? When comparing your maps to the late 20th Century average temperature, what would you expect the Little Ice temperatures to be; above or below average? What about the Medieval Warm period and your other averages. Do your maps look as you would expect them to considering what you know about climate change? Or, as in most geospatial analysis, do your expectations hold true in some areas and not in others. How robust do you believe the extended temperature records extrapolated from proxy data are? Would you be willing to predict future climate scenarios from that data? Why or why not?\n\n\n\nPart 3: Upload an ArcGIS Package\nSix Isarithmic temperature maps belong in your project. They should be maps of temperature anomalies for an Average of all 1400 years, the 1961 to 1990 Average, the Medieval Warm Period, the Little Ice Age, the Industrial Revolution, and the last decade in the data. All the maps should be normalized with the same class breaks and the same color ramp, except for the Last Decade map. That means the same legend for each.\nYou will submit your final series of maps as an ArcGIS Pro Package uploaded ot ArcGIS Online.\n\nOpen the “Package Project” tool in the Geoprocessing toolbox. Select your EuropeClimate project as the input project, and create a EuropeClimate_[YOUR LAST NAME] package as your output file. Select the “Share outside of organization” parameter, which ensures all of your layers are included as part of the package. Scroll to the bottom of the tool, and un-check “Include TOolbooxes”. Keep all of the other parameters as their default values, and click Run.\nSign in to ArcGIS Online. Under the Content tab, click “New Item” in the upper left hand corner, and either drag and drop your EuropeClimate_[YOUR LAST NAME] package into the window, or browse to the package to upload it.\nAfter the upload completes, edit the information about your package. Add a brief summary about your package, and then a description of its contents.\nSelect “Share” on the right side of your package page, select “Edit Group Sharing” and share the package with the Applications of GIS — Spring 2024 group. Select “OK” and “Save”, and your project will be shared with our group for download and viewing.",

    "text": "You will do all of your work in this class with the open source (and free!) R programming language. You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.\n\nInstall R\nFirst you need to install the latest version of R itself (the engine), currently 4.3.2 (Eye Holes).\n\nGo to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) website: https://cran.r-project.org/\nClick on “Download R for XXX”, where XXX is either Mac or Windows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use macOS, scroll down to the first .pkg file in the list of files and download it.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use Windows, click “base” (or click on the bolded “install R for the first time” link) and download it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble click on the downloaded file (check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\nInstall OS specific programs\n\n\nmacOS only: download and install XQuartz.\nWindows only: download and install Rtools\n\n\n\nInstall RStudio\nNext, you need to install RStudio, the nicer graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won’t ever have to interact with it directly.\n\nGo to the free download location on RStudio’s website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\nThe website should automatically detect your operating system (Linux, macOS or Windows) and show a big download button for it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n\nDouble click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).\n\n\nInstall tidyverse\nR packages are easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on “Install,” type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can sometimes be tedious when you’re installing lots of packages, though. The tidyverse, for instance, consists of dozens of packages (including ggplot2) that all work together. Rather than install each individually, you can install a single magical package and get them all at the same time.\nGo to the packages panel in RStudio, click on “Install,” type “tidyverse”, and press enter. You’ll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages are installed.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice also that RStudio will generate a line of code for you and run it: install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). You can also just paste and run this instead of using the packages panel.\n\n\nInstall tinytex\nWhen you knit to PDF, R uses a special scientific typesetting program named LaTeX, which is complicated and a large download. To make life easier, there’s an R package named tinytex that installs a minimal LaTeX program and that automatically deals with differences between macOS and Windows.\nTo install tinytex:\n\nUse the Packages in panel in RStudio to install tinytex like you did above with tidyverse. Alternatively, run install.packages(\"tinytex\") in the console.\nRun tinytex::install_tinytex() in the console.\nWait for a bit while R downloads and installs everything you need.\nYou should now be able to knit to PDF."
