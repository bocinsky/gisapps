You are welcome to use your own computers for the labs if you’d like, but beware as your mileage may vary. I’ve prepared installation instructions for Windows, MacOS (Apple Silicon), and MacOS (Intel), and the course instructors will be available during the lab section on Thursday, January 18 to troubleshoot getting it up and running on your computers. Access to ArcPro is provided at no cost to students. Be mindful of the ArcPro system requirements, but note my instructions on how to get it up and running on MacOS.\nStudents are welcome to attempt to do the labs using alternative software, such as QGIS, R, or Python. You won’t be graded on the software you use, only on the quality of your writeup and results. The course instructors will try to advise and assist with other software as best they can."

The Classes/GISApps folder is by far the easiest place to store your ArcPro data while in this class.\nThe Classes folder will automatically map for everyone in the Stone Hall labs as the “T:\\\\” drive. However, if you need to access the drive from the library or another location on campus, you need to follow the instructions below to map the Classes drive. You need to be connected to ethernet on campus, or eduroam wifi to access the Classes folder.\nDrive mapping instructions: https://umtqsg.atlassian.net/l/cp/Pp2Vgu2M\n\nServer and Share name for Windows: \\\\data.cfc.umt.edu\\Classes$\nsmb://data.cfc.umt.edu/Classes$ for MacOS (available via the Finder menu bar → Go → Connect to Server…)\nUsername: first.last@umt.edu and your normal password\n\nThat will take you to the root of the classes folder, you can see some instructions for signing into available software and general lab info in the root of that folder. Your folder is GISApps and within that, you will see a Labs folder and a Students folder. Labs is intended to store materials/data that that we will share with you prior to the labs. Students will contain a folder for each student in our class where you can store whatever they want/need and is named with your NetID. The only folder students may view or modify is their own folder. The Labs folder is read only for students.\n\n\nFlash Drive (optional)\nA thumb-drive or external hard drive with at least 4 GB of space may prove useful.\nPro tip: Create a Word doc on the drive called “1st Owner Information.” Use the number one in the title and it will always be on top in the file list. Type up all you contact information so when you lose your drive it can be returned."

    "section": "Expectations",
    "text": "Expectations\n\nEmails\nOn a daily basis, I receive 40–50 emails that are related to the work that I do for the university. I often spend several hours a day reading and responding to emails. Before emailing me, please read the syllabus to see if your question is answered in the syllabus. Try to ask assignment questions in class when I ask if there are any questions. For questions you may not want to ask in front of the whole class, you may speak to me after class. If none of those options will work, please email me or see me during student hours.\nWhen emailing, please compose a polite, concise email from your UM email address with a clear subject line. This will ensure that your email isn’t inadvertently sent to my junk mail.\nAll professors and TAs are only expected to respond to emails during working hours and business days, and generally within two business days. Don’t expect responses on the weekends. If I don’t get back to you within 2 business days, please email me again.\n\n\nClassroom Participation\nStudents are expected to attend all classes in person unless they have communicated a reason for absence with the instructor—if you are going to miss class, please communicate that to me ahead of time. Students are individually responsible for all information presented in lectures, Voices of GIS interviews, assigned readings, and class assignments. Classroom participation will be assessed via attendance, attention, pop-quizzes, and active participation in group-discussions. There will be several unannounced reading and participation quizzes. Combined, these quizzes and your participation total 10 percent of your grade. Thus, consistent attendance and regularly doing the readings are required to do well in the course.\n\nCultural Leave Policy\nCultural or ceremonial leave allows excused absences for cultural, religious, and ceremonial purposes to meet the student’s customs and traditions or to participate in related activities. To receive an authorized absence for a cultural, religious or ceremonial event the student or their advisor (proxy) must submit a formal written request to the instructor. This must include a brief description (with inclusive dates) of the cultural event or ceremony and the importance of the student’s attendance or participation. Authorization for the absence is subject to approval by the instructor. Appeals may be made to the Chair, Dean or Provost. The excused absence or leave may not exceed five academic calendar days (not including weekends or holidays). Students remain responsible for completion or make-up of assignments as defined in the syllabus, at the discretion of the instructor.\n\n\nFamily Policy\nUM does not have an official family policy, so the following guidelines reflect my own beliefs and commitments towards parent students2\n\nBabies are welcome in class as often as necessary for support feeding relationship.\nYou are welcome to bring your child to class in order to cover unforeseeable gaps in childcare.\nIf you come with babies or toddler, I ask that you sit close to the door so that, in case your little one needs special attention and is disrupting the learning of other students, you may step outside of class until their needs are met. Seats close to the door are reserved for parents attending class with their child.\n\n\n\n\nLate Assignments and Exams\nThe lab write-ups and assignments due in class on the day indicated in the assignment description, generally the Thursday of the following week. Late lab write-ups or other assignments will not be accepted. If you anticipate problems with any deadlines, talk with or notify me prior to missing an assignment or exam. Make-up exams will only be given in the rarest of circumstances.\n\n\nClassroom Etiquette\nAs a learning community, it is important for us to work together to ensure that we are fostering a positive and respectful learning environment for all. Below are some selected guidelines.\n\nPlease ensure that you are prepared for class by doing the assignments, having supplies in hand, and being prepared to learn and participate.\nNote-taking with devices (e.g. laptops, iPads) is allowed, but please stay on task. Doing other homework, checking your Reddit, Snapchat, Tik Tok, stocks, the UM basketball score, or anything else not related to the class is not only distracting to you but also to your neighbors.\nPlease be considerate about your food choices, especially those that are noisy or particularly odorous. Coffee is encouraged.\nUnless we are doing group work, please do not carry on private conversations with others.\nWhile I do want you to enjoy this course, please be respectful and act professionally towards your colleagues and me.\nPlease do not text while I am lecturing. Why? It is really distracting to me.\n\n\n\nDisruptive Behavior\nFaculty members at the University of Montana have the independent authority to exclude a student from any class session in which the student displays disruptive behavior that threatens the learning environment and/or safety and well-being of others in the classroom.\n\nIf circumstances warrant dismissal from a class session for behavior reasons, the faculty member should contact the Student Conduct Officer immediately following the class to discuss the situation and make a determination about whether Student Conduct Code charges will be initiated.\nThe student remains eligible to return to the next class session.\nThe faculty member maintains the authority to remove the student from any future class session during which the student is disruptive.\nThe student may be suspended permanently from a class upon recommendation of the Dean of the college or school offering the class in accordance with the disciplinary procedures outlined in the Article V: Proscribed General Conduct section of the Student Conduct Code.\n\n\n\nAcademic Conduct\nFor a full list of regulations and procedures please see the Student Conduct Code.\nStudents at the University of Montana are expected to practice academic honesty at all times. Academic misconduct is subject to academic penalties by the course instructor and/or University sanctions by the University through the Provost and Vice Provost for Academic Affairs.\nAcademic misconduct is defined as all forms of academic dishonesty, including but not limited to:\n\nPlagiarism: Representing another person’s words, ideas, data, or materials as one’s own.\nMisconduct during an examination or academic exercise: Copying from another student’s paper, consulting unauthorized material, giving information to another student, collaborating with one or more students without authorization, or otherwise failing to abide by the University or instructor’s rules governing the examination or academic exercise without the instructor’s permission.\nUnauthorized possession of examination or other course materials: Acquiring or possessing an examination or other course materials without authorization by the instructor.\nTampering with course materials: Destroying, hiding, or otherwise tampering with source materials, library materials, laboratory materials, computer equipment or programs, or other course materials.\nSubmitting false information: Knowingly submitting false, altered, or invented information, data, quotations, citations, or documentation in connection with an academic exercise.\nSubmitting work previously presented in another course: Knowingly making such submission in violation of stated course requirements.\nImproperly influencing conduct: Acting calculatedly to influence an instructor to assign a grade other than the grade actually earned.\nSubstituting, or arranging substitution, for another student during an examination or other academic exercise: Knowingly allowing others to offer one’s work as their own.\nFacilitating academic dishonesty: Knowingly helping or attempting to help another person commit an act of academic dishonesty, including assistance in an arrangement whereby any work, classroom performance, examination activity, or other academic exercise is submitted or performed by a person other than the student under whose name the work is submitted or performed.\nAltering transcripts, grades, examinations, or other academically related documents: Falsifying, tampering with, or misrepresenting a transcript, other academic records, or any material relevant to academic performance, enrollment, or admission, or causing falsification or misrepresentation of any of the above.\n\n\nPenalties for academic misconduct\nDepending on the severity of the academic misconduct, a student may incur one or more of the following penalties:\n\nAcademic Penalty(ies) by the Course Instructor: The student may receive a failing or reduced grade in an academic exercise, examination, or course, and/or be assigned additional work which may include re-examination.\nUniversity Sanction(s): The University may also impose a sanction that exceeds the academic penalty. Sanctions (c) through (f) require administrative review and approval by the Provost and Vice Provost for Academic Affairs:\n\n\nDisciplinary Warning: The student is warned that further misconduct may result in more severe disciplinary sanctions.\nDisciplinary Probation: The student is warned that further misconduct may result in suspension or expulsion. Conditions may be placed on continued enrollment for a specified period of time.\nSuspension: The student is separated from the University for a specified period of time and may also be excluded from participation in any University-sponsored activity.\nExpulsion: The student is permanently separated from the University and may also be excluded from any University-owned and/or -controlled property or events.\nDenial of a Degree: A degree is not awarded.\nRevocation of a Degree: A previously awarded degree is rescinded.\n\n\n\nA Note on GenerativeAI\nUM does not currently have a specific policy on the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI), as this is a new and rapidly developing technology. As such, I reviewed emerging guidance on the use of AI in courses such as this one. I’ve adapted the following statement from a resource at North Carolina State University. Most of the text was adapted from a conversation with the AI tool Bing Chat (powered by GPT-4).\nThis course permits you to use AI tools, such as chatbots, text generators, paraphrasers, summarizers, or solvers, to get guidance on assignments, as long as you do so in an ethical and responsible manner. Essentially, you can think of these tools as ways to help you learn (and to problem-solve particular ArcGIS tasks) but not to entirely create text for assignments like labs, final projects, discussion wuestions. AI is more like your tutor or TA, not a replacement for your independent thinking.\nThis means that you must:\n\nNot use AI tools to replace your own thinking or analysis or to avoid engaging with the course content.\nCite or explain any AI tools you use. Provide the name of the AI tool, the date of access, the URL of the interface, and the specific prompt or query you used to generate the output. This is especially critical for any creative solution you come across.\nBe transparent and honest about how you used the AI tool and how it contributed to your assignment. Explain what you learned from the AI tool, how you verified its accuracy and reliability, how you integrated its output with your own work, and how you acknowledged its limitations and biases.\n\nYou are accountable for any mistakes or errors made by the AI tool. Do not rely on the AI tool to produce flawless or correct results. Always check and edit the output before submitting your work. If you discover any inaccuracies or inconsistencies in the output after submission, notify the instructor immediately and correct them as soon as possible.\nUsing AI tools in an unethical or irresponsible manner, such as copying or paraphrasing the output without citation or transparency, using the output as your own work without verification or integration, or using the output to misrepresent your knowledge or skills, is considered a form of academic dishonesty and will result in a zero grade for the assignment and possible disciplinary action. If you have any questions about what constitutes ethical and responsible use of AI tools, please consult with the instructor before submitting your work.\nAlso, please remember that AI tools are only as unbiased as the data they are trained on. If the training data for the AI includes bias, the results generated by the AI will also be biased. In this way, AI tools can perpetuate the biases present in their original training sets, leading to discrimination against certain groups of people and reinforcing pre-existing inequalities and stereotypes. I encourage you to reflect on the limitations and potential biases of AI-generated content and to use it responsibly."

Exams will have several sections starting with multiple choice and true or false questions. Then there will be a definition matching section based on the glossary terms in the readings. Finally, essay questions will require you to evaluate a map, outline the theory behind a GIS analysis technique, or discuss other course content. The final exam is comprehensive, including content evaluated by the midterm exam. The Final Exam is longer and is worth more points (250) than the Midterm (200). Exams are closed-book.",

    "text": "Final Group Projects (600 points)\nA semester-long assignment, the group GIS project requires the students to identify a unique resource management problem that can be answered with GIS analysis. Each group must submit a project proposal following a format that will be discussed in class. As a group, you will develop a research question, review the literature for what techniques have been applied previously, decide what data is required, and design the methods for your analysis. You will document your analysis in an ESRI StoryMap that will roughly follow the scientific format used in the lab reports with the addition of a small literature review. You will include maps, graphs, tables, and figures that support your research and its results. The project design, workflow and conclusions will be presented to the class at the end of the semester. The 600 point project is worth 30 percent of your total grade and is divided as follows:\n\n\n\nComponent\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nProject Proposal\n100 pts.\n\n\nFinal Group StoryMap\n400 pts.\n\n\nPresentation\n100 pts.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "You will do all of your work in this class with the open source (and free!) R programming language. You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.\n\nInstall R\nFirst you need to install the latest version of R itself (the engine), currently 4.3.2 (Eye Holes).\n\nGo to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) website: https://cran.r-project.org/\nClick on “Download R for XXX”, where XXX is either Mac or Windows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use macOS, scroll down to the first .pkg file in the list of files and download it.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use Windows, click “base” (or click on the bolded “install R for the first time” link) and download it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble click on the downloaded file (check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\nInstall OS specific programs\n\n\nmacOS only: download and install XQuartz.\nWindows only: download and install Rtools\n\n\n\nInstall RStudio\nNext, you need to install RStudio, the nicer graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won’t ever have to interact with it directly.\n\nGo to the free download location on RStudio’s website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\nThe website should automatically detect your operating system (Linux, macOS or Windows) and show a big download button for it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n\nDouble click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).\n\n\nInstall tidyverse\nR packages are easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on “Install,” type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can sometimes be tedious when you’re installing lots of packages, though. The tidyverse, for instance, consists of dozens of packages (including ggplot2) that all work together. Rather than install each individually, you can install a single magical package and get them all at the same time.\nGo to the packages panel in RStudio, click on “Install,” type “tidyverse”, and press enter. You’ll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages are installed.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice also that RStudio will generate a line of code for you and run it: install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). You can also just paste and run this instead of using the packages panel.\n\n\nInstall tinytex\nWhen you knit to PDF, R uses a special scientific typesetting program named LaTeX, which is complicated and a large download. To make life easier, there’s an R package named tinytex that installs a minimal LaTeX program and that automatically deals with differences between macOS and Windows.\nTo install tinytex:\n\nUse the Packages in panel in RStudio to install tinytex like you did above with tidyverse. Alternatively, run install.packages(\"tinytex\") in the console.\nRun tinytex::install_tinytex() in the console.\nWait for a bit while R downloads and installs everything you need.\nYou should now be able to knit to PDF."
