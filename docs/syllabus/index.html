<h1>TL;DR</h1>
<p>Good try! Read the syllabus. It is your best bet for success in this course, and any other courses you may be taking.</p>
</section>
<section id="overview" class="level1">
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>GIS is the science of answering spatial questions with the proper use of geographic information. The main concern is the analytical application of tools for investigating the distribution of physical and cultural phenomena on the surface of Earth. Unfortunately, the majority of maps in the modern discourse grossly distort the data and lie to the user. This most likely stems from a lack of basic cartographic knowledge and usually happens when a graphic designer is tasked with throwing data on a map. Decades of academic study into user perceptions, proper data management, and effective techniques inform a large body of geographic science that we will use as a foundation for applied GIS analysis. You will learn to ask appropriate spatial questions, construct methods for analysis, and produce maps that truthfully represent the answers.</p>
<p>The course will discuss major concepts and theories behind several GIS applications and put those skills into practice with laboratory exercises using GIS software. We will sample the use of GIS science in multiple disciplines, highlighting the unique skills required to effectively use GIS in those fields.</p>
<section id="objectives" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>To learn the tools of spatial analysis in order to properly make spatial decisions in a variety of GIS applications.</li>
<li>To understand the structure and analysis of nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio data in a spatial context.</li>
<li>To become proficient in the construction of choropleth, dot density, proportional symbol, isarithmic, and cartogram maps.</li>
<li>To develop software skills in programs used for GIS analysis in the modern geographic information workflow.</li>
<li>To learn to overcome software limitations and produce aesthetically pleasing maps that convey design rather than automatic generation.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="learning-outcomes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>By the end of this course you will:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Understand the terminology, structures, concepts, and theories of GIS project management.</li>
<li>Gain necessary skills to perform spatial analyses using various data within a GIS environment.</li>
<li>Learn common GIS applications associated with managing natural and cultural resources.</li>
<li>Be proficient in applying the scientific methods to spatial problem solving.</li>
<li>Know the proper styles and formats for documenting research in a scientific report.</li>
</ol>
</section>
</section>
<section id="course-format" class="level1">
<h1>Course Format</h1>
<p>The general program for each week will be Tuesday and Thursday lectures, followed by a lab section. However, this schedule is subject to change, and will vary with the needs of the class, workload, or in special circumstances. This is especially true towards the end of the semester.</p>
<p>Lecture days will start with announcements, and then move to group map critiques or class discussion of readings. This will be followed by a lecture on principles of GIS.</p>
<p>On occasional Thursdays during the lecture hour, we will hear from <em>Voices of GIS</em>. I have invited several people I feel are doing impactful work with geospatial data to join us in class and be interviewed. Each guest speaker will share a tool, paper, app, or analysis thy have had a hand in developing, and we’ll have a discussion about potential geospatial careers in their field. <strong>You will be responsible for submitting thoughtful questions for our guests ahead of time.</strong> I’ll parse through your questions and let them guide the interviews.</p>
<p>New lab assignments will be introduced during Tuesday lectures and will be due a week after they are assigned. The majority of the labs will not be written up in a button-by-button click format. You are expected to refer back to previous skills learned in other courses, tutorials provided by the instructor, the ESRI Help directory and outside resources found on the web. Utilize your time in the labs to ask questions of your fellow students, the TA, and the instructor.</p>
</section>
<section id="course-materials" class="level1">
<h1>Course Materials</h1>
<p>I will provide slides, and sometimes notes. In addition to those, there will be assigned readings from textbooks and reference papers.</p>
<section id="course-software" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="course-software">Course Software</h2>
<p>The labs are written for <a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/overview">ArcGIS Pro 3.2.1 (ArcPro)</a>. ArcPro is installed on the computers in the lab in Stone Hall. You are welcome to use your own computers for the labs if you’d like, but beware as your mileage may vary. I’ve prepared installation instructions for <a href="https://umtgis.github.io/guides/install/windows.html">Windows</a>, <a href="https://umtgis.github.io/guides/install/mac_apple_silicon.html">MacOS (Apple Silicon)</a>, and <a href="https://umtgis.github.io/guides/install/mac_intel.html">MacOS (Intel)</a>, and the course instructors will be available during the lab section on Thursday, January 18 to troubleshoot getting it up and running on your computers. Access to ArcPro is provided at no cost to students. Be mindful of the <a href="https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/get-started/arcgis-pro-system-requirements.htm">ArcPro system requirements</a>, but note my instructions on how to get it up and running on MacOS.</p>
<p>Students are welcome to attempt to do the labs using alternative software, such as <a href="https://www.qgis.org/en/site/">QGIS</a>, <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a>, or <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a>. You won’t be graded on the software you use, only on the quality of your writeup and results. The course instructors will try to advise and assist with other software as best they can.</p>
</section>
<section id="course-texts" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="course-texts">Course Texts</h2>
<p>Course notes for the class can be found <a href="..">on the course website</a>. There will also be assigned readings from <a href="https://open.lib.umn.edu/mapping/">Mapping, Society, and Technology</a> <span class="citation" data-cites="Manson:2017">(<a href="#ref-Manson:2017" role="doc-biblioref">Manson, 2017</a>)</span>, which is available online for free reading. There will be various supplemental readings supplied as pdfs throughout the semester. The <a href="https://gistbok.ucgis.org">GIS&amp;T Body of Knowledge</a> is an impressive resource for geographic information sciences, and you’d be wise to familiarize yourself with it.</p>
</section>
<section id="storage" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="storage">Storage</h2>
<section id="um-fcfc-file-server-t-drive" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="um-fcfc-file-server-t-drive">UM FCFC File Server (“T:\\ Drive”)</h3>
<p>The FCFC IT team has created a folder for our GISApps class under our <strong>Classes/GISApps</strong> folder on the UM FCFC file server. <strong>The <em>Classes/GISApps</em> folder is by far the easiest place to store your ArcPro data while in this class.</strong></p>
<p>The Classes folder will automatically map for everyone in the Stone Hall labs as the “T:\\” drive. However, if you need to access the drive from the library or another location on campus, you need to follow the instructions below to map the <strong>Classes</strong> drive. You need to be connected to ethernet on campus, or <em>eduroam</em> wifi to access the <strong>Classes</strong> folder.</p>
<p>Drive mapping instructions: <a href="https://umtqsg.atlassian.net/l/cp/Pp2Vgu2M" class="uri">https://umtqsg.atlassian.net/l/cp/Pp2Vgu2M</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Server and Share name for Windows: <strong>\\data.cfc.umt.edu\Classes$</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="smb://data.cfc.umt.edu/Classes$" class="uri">smb://data.cfc.umt.edu/Classes$</a></strong> for MacOS (available via the <strong>Finder menu bar → Go → Connect to Server…</strong>)</li>
<li>Username: <strong>first.last@umt.edu</strong> and your normal password</li>
</ul>
<p>That will take you to the root of the classes folder, you can see some instructions for signing into available software and general lab info in the root of that folder. Your folder is GISApps and within that, you will see a <strong>Labs</strong> folder and a <strong>Students</strong> folder. <strong>Labs</strong> is intended to store materials/data that that we will share with you prior to the labs. <strong>Students</strong> will contain a folder for each student in our class where you can store whatever they want/need and is named with your NetID. The only folder students may view or modify is their own folder. The <strong>Labs</strong> folder is read only for students.</p>
</section>
<section id="flash-drive-optional" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="flash-drive-optional">Flash Drive (optional)</h3>
<p>A thumb-drive or external hard drive with at least 4 GB of space may prove useful.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Create a Word doc on the drive called “1st Owner Information.” Use the number one in the title and it will always be on top in the file list. Type up all you contact information so when you lose your drive it can be returned.</p>

<section id="emails" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="emails">Emails</h3>
<p>On a daily basis, I receive 40–50 emails that are related to the work that I do for the university. I often spend several hours a day reading and responding to emails. Before emailing me, please read the syllabus to see if your question is answered in the syllabus. Try to ask assignment questions in class when I ask if there are any questions. For questions you may not want to ask in front of the whole class, you may speak to me after class. If none of those options will work, please email me or see me during student hours.</p>
<p>When emailing, please compose a polite, concise email <em>from your UM email address</em> with a clear subject line. This will ensure that your email isn’t inadvertently sent to my junk mail.</p>
<p>All professors and TAs are only expected to respond to emails during working hours and business days, and generally within two business days. Don’t expect responses on the weekends. If I don’t get back to you within 2 business days, please email me again.</p>

<section id="classroom-participation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="classroom-participation">Classroom Participation</h3>
<p>Students are expected to attend all classes in person unless they have communicated a reason for absence with the instructor—if you are going to miss class, please communicate that to me ahead of time. Students are individually responsible for all information presented in lectures, <em>Voices of GIS</em> interviews, assigned readings, and class assignments. Classroom participation will be assessed via attendance, attention, pop-quizzes, and active participation in group-discussions. There will be several unannounced reading and participation quizzes. Combined, these quizzes and your participation total 10 percent of your grade. Thus, consistent attendance and regularly doing the readings are required to do well in the course.</p>
<section id="cultural-leave-policy" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cultural-leave-policy">Cultural Leave Policy</h4>
<p>Cultural or ceremonial leave allows excused absences for cultural, religious, and ceremonial purposes to meet the student’s customs and traditions or to participate in related activities. To receive an authorized absence for a cultural, religious or ceremonial event the student or their advisor (proxy) must submit a formal written request to the instructor. This must include a brief description (with inclusive dates) of the cultural event or ceremony and the importance of the student’s attendance or participation. Authorization for the absence is subject to approval by the instructor. Appeals may be made to the Chair, Dean or Provost. The excused absence or leave may not exceed five academic calendar days (not including weekends or holidays). Students remain responsible for completion or make-up of assignments as defined in the syllabus, at the discretion of the instructor.</p>

<section id="a-note-on-generativeai" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-note-on-generativeai">A Note on GenerativeAI</h4>
<p>UM does not currently have a specific policy on the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI), as this is a new and rapidly developing technology. As such, I reviewed emerging guidance on the use of AI in courses such as this one. I’ve adapted the following statement from a <a href="https://teaching-resources.delta.ncsu.edu/develop-an-ai-syllabus-statement/">resource at North Carolina State University</a>. Most of the text was adapted from a conversation with the AI tool Bing Chat (powered by GPT-4).</p>
<p>This course permits you to use AI tools, such as chatbots, text generators, paraphrasers, summarizers, or solvers, to get guidance on assignments, as long as you do so in an ethical and responsible manner. Essentially, you can think of these tools as ways to help you learn (and to problem-solve particular ArcGIS tasks) but not to entirely create text for assignments like labs, final projects, discussion wuestions. AI is more like your tutor or TA, not a replacement for your independent thinking.</p>
<p>This means that you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not use AI tools to replace your own thinking or analysis or to avoid engaging with the course content.</li>
<li>Cite or explain any AI tools you use. Provide the name of the AI tool, the date of access, the URL of the interface, and the specific prompt or query you used to generate the output. This is especially critical for any creative solution you come across.</li>
<li>Be transparent and honest about how you used the AI tool and how it contributed to your assignment. Explain what you learned from the AI tool, how you verified its accuracy and reliability, how you integrated its output with your own work, and how you acknowledged its limitations and biases.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are accountable for any mistakes or errors made by the AI tool. Do not rely on the AI tool to produce flawless or correct results. Always check and edit the output before submitting your work. If you discover any inaccuracies or inconsistencies in the output after submission, notify the instructor immediately and correct them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Using AI tools in an unethical or irresponsible manner, such as copying or paraphrasing the output without citation or transparency, using the output as your own work without verification or integration, or using the output to misrepresent your knowledge or skills, is considered a form of academic dishonesty and will result in a zero grade for the assignment and possible disciplinary action. If you have any questions about what constitutes ethical and responsible use of AI tools, please consult with the instructor before submitting your work.</p>
<p>Also, please remember that AI tools are only as unbiased as the data they are trained on. If the training data for the AI includes bias, the results generated by the AI will also be biased. In this way, AI tools can perpetuate the biases present in their original training sets, leading to discrimination against certain groups of people and reinforcing pre-existing inequalities and stereotypes. I encourage you to reflect on the limitations and potential biases of AI-generated content and to use it responsibly.</p>
