    "text": "Install R\nFirst you need to install the latest version of R itself (the engine), currently 4.2.1 (Funny-Looking Kid).\n\nGo to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) website: https://cran.r-project.org/\nClick on “Download R for XXX”, where XXX is either Mac or Windows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use macOS, scroll down to the first .pkg file in the list of files and download it.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use Windows, click “base” (or click on the bolded “install R for the first time” link) and download it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble click on the downloaded file (check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\nIf you use macOS, download and install XQuartz. You do not need to do this on Windows.\n\n\n\nInstall RStudio\nNext, you need to install RStudio, the nicer graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won’t ever have to interact with it directly.\n\nGo to the free download location on RStudio’s website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\nThe website should automatically detect your operating system (Linux, macOS or Windows) and show a big download button for it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n\nDouble click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).\n\n\nInstall tidyverse\nR packages are easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on “Install,” type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can sometimes be tedious when you’re installing lots of packages, though. The tidyverse, for instance, consists of dozens of packages (including ggplot2) that all work together. Rather than install each individually, you can install a single magical package and get them all at the same time.\nGo to the packages panel in RStudio, click on “Install,” type “tidyverse”, and press enter. You’ll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages are installed.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice also that RStudio will generate a line of code for you and run it: install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). You can also just paste and run this instead of using the packages panel.\n\n\nInstall tinytex\nWhen you knit to PDF, R uses a special scientific typesetting program named LaTeX, which is complicated and a large download. To make life easier, there’s an R package named tinytex that installs a minimal LaTeX program and that automatically deals with differences between macOS and Windows.\nTo install tinytex:\n\nUse the Packages in panel in RStudio to install tinytex like you did above with tidyverse. Alternatively, run install.packages(\"tinytex\") in the console.\nRun tinytex::install_tinytex() in the console.\nWait for a bit while R downloads and installs everything you need.\nYou should now be able to knit to PDF."
